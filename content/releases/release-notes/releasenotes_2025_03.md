## Contour Map Improvements

![](/images/3d-main-window/ensemble-grid-contour-map.png)

ResInsight can create contour maps from an ensemble of grid models based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D plane. The grid models can have varying grid geometry.

New calculations have been added to contour maps, and Mobile Oil/Gas/Hydrocarbon Column is now supported.
