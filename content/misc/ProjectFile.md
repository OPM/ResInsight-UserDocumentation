### The Project File

ResInsight stores all views and settings in a **Project File** with the extension _`*.rsp`_ to easily continue work in a subsequent session. 
This file only contains *references* to the real data files, and does not in any way copy the data itself. 
Data files generated by ResInsight are also referenced by the Project File.

The <code>*.rsp</code> file is an XML file, and can be edited by any text editor.

### External File References

Editing the **Project File** is one effective way to replace source cases and other file references. At top of a **Project File**, the section **ReferencedExternalFiles** contains aliases to file paths which can be modified using a text editor. It is also possible to use automated tools to modify these text strings.

```txt
<ReferencedExternalFiles>
    $PathId_001$ D:/resinsight-data/norne/NORNE_ATW2013.EGRID;
    $PathId_002$ D:/resinsight-data/NorneODB/norne_case2.odb;
    $PathId_003$ D:/resinsight-data/norne/NORNE_ATW2013.SMSPEC;
    $PathId_004$ D:/resinsight-data/summary_templates;
</ReferencedExternalFiles>
```
