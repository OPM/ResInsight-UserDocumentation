For large projects with many views and many grid models, it can take some time to navigate to the information you are looking for. We have now added a special dialog named **Quick Access**, where selected information from a view is displayed. The default location for the dialog is at to the right of the 3D views.

When a 3D view is selected, the following information will be displayed in the **Quick Access** dialog
- The connected grid case
- IJK value for a IJK cell range filter
- The minimum and maximum range for a property filter

It is now possible to collapse the 3D view in the **Property Editor** and still be able to manipulate some properties of the view.
