For large projects with numerous views and grid models, navigating to the desired information can be time-consuming. To address this, we have introduced a special dialog named **Quick Access**, which displays selected information from a view. By default, this dialog is located to the right of the 3D views.

When a 3D view is selected, the **Quick Access** dialog will display the following information:
- The connected grid case
- IJK value for an IJK cell range filter
- The minimum and maximum range for a property filter

You can now collapse the 3D view in the **Property Editor** and still manipulate some properties of the view.
