## Seismic View
Import of data is described in [Seismic Data]({{< relref "seismicdata" >}}). A seismic view can be created based on a seismic cube. This view can display seismic data, wells and annotation object. To visualize both grid data and seismic data in the same view, see [Seismic Sections]({{< relref "seismicsections" >}}).

## Seismic View features
When seismic data is present, a new **Seismic View** can be created from the right-click menu of a seismic data source or the seismic views folder item. Seismic sections can be created for display of seismic data on intersections. See [Seismic Sections]({{< relref "seismicsections" >}}) for more details.

Surfaces and surface intersection lines can optionally be visualized on the seismic intersections.
