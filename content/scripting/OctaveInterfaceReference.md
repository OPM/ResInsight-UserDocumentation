## Introduction
To identify a ResInsight case uniquely in the Octave script, an integer Id (CaseId) is used. This Id can be retrieved in several ways, but there are two main modes of operation regarding this for a particular octave script: Either the script is designed to work on a single case (the "Current Case"), or the script is designed to access the selection and traverse the cases by itself.

### Single Case Scripts
Single case scripts do not need to address cases explicitly, but works on what ResInsight considers being the "Current Case". When the user selects several cases and executes a script on them, ResInsight loops over all cases in the selection, sets the current case and executes the script. All references to the "Current Case" from the script will then refer to the case currently being processed by ResInsight. 
The Current Case can be accessed directly using **riGetCurrentCase()**, but the more direct way is to *omit the CaseId parameter* in the functions, the Current Case is then automatically used. 

### Multi Case Scripts
Scripts can access the selection state in ResInsight, and also retrieve lists of Case Groups and cases including some meta information. This can be used if the scripts need to get values from some cases, and store the results in others, etc.

### Case Types
The case type (Labeled "CaseType" in the following specification) of a case is returned as a text string when retrieving lists of cases, and is one of the following:

| Case Type      | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
|ResultCase     | A binary Eclipse case |
|InputCase      | A case based on ASCII Eclipse input data |
|StatisticsCase | A statistics case based on many source cases in Grid Case Group | 
|SourceCase     | A binary Eclipse case in a Grid Case Group |

### Unresolved Issues
The issue around having multiple instances of ResInsight is still not addressed, but might affect the function signatures by adding a port number parameter to all of them. We will try to find ways to avoid this, but are still not certain that we will succeed.

## Specification

### Project Information
The case information is presented in an octave Structure called CaseInfo, and contains the following fields:

    CaseInfo = {
      CaseId      = int    # A project-unique integer used to address this
                           # particular case 
      CaseName    = string # The name that has been assigned to the case
                           # in ResInsight.
      CaseType    = string # See the description above
      CaseGroupId = int    # A project-unique integer identifying the
                           # CaseGroup this case is a member of.
                           # -1 if not in a CaseGroup. Valid only for 
                           # Statistics-, and SourceCases
    }

#### CaseInfo riGetCurrentCase()
This function returns a CaseInfo Structure for the Case considered being the "Current Case" by ResInsight. When ResInsight loops over a selection of cases and executes an Octave script for each of them, this function returns the CaseInfo for that particular Case. 

#### Vector[CaseInfo] riGetSelectedCases()
This function returns a CaseInfo Structure for each of the cases selected in ResInsight at the time when the script launched. 

#### Vector[CaseGroupInfo] riGetCaseGroups()
This function returns a CaseGroupInfo Structure for each of the case groups in the current ResInsight project.

    CaseGroupInfo = {
      CaseGroupId   = int    # A project-unique integer used to address
                             # this particular CaseGroup
      CaseGroupName = string # The name assigned to the CaseGroup 
                             # in ResInsight
    }
    
#### Vector[CaseInfo] riGetCases([CaseGroupId])
This function returns a CaseInfo Structure for all the cases in the current ResInsight project, including the Statistics cases and Source cases in a Grid Case Group. 
If a CaseGroupId is provided, only the cases in that Case Group will be returned.
 
### Retrieving Grid Metadata

                    # Main grid has index 0
      I, J, K       # 1-based index address of the cell in the grid.
      ParentGridIdx # The index to the grid that this cell's grid 
                    # is residing in.
      PI, PJ, PK    # 1-based address of the parent grid cell that
                    # this cell is a part of.
      CoarseBoxIdx  # 1-based coarsening box index, -1 if none.
                    # Coarsening box info can be retrieved using
                    # **riGetCoarseningInfo()**
