This chaper describes the following aspects of wells and completions:

- how wells defined in the simulation are displayed and how to control the different aspects of their visualization
- retrieval of well trajectories from file and an internal Equinor web service
- the creation of user-defined well paths
- display of well log curves directly in a 3D view based on well log data from a simulation model or imported LAS-files
- modeling and export of completions including perforation intervals, fishbone wells and fractures in order to perform refined simulations
- creating and exporting local grid refinement (LGRs) in main grid cells intersected by completions

The following subchapters details the functionality and capabilites.
