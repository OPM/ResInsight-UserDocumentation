## Grid Calculations

[Grid Property Calculations]({{< relref "gridpropertycalculator" >}}) perform better for multiple (large) grid models
 
## Polygons
![]({{< relref "" >}}images/3d-main-window/PolygonHeading.png)

- [Polygons]({{< relref "polygons" >}}) are now available as project objects, and a can be displayed in 3D views. A polygon can also be used to define an intersection and polygon cell filters. Polygons can be imported from a file, or created from a selection of cells in the 3D view. Polygons can be exported to file.
- A polygon cell filter can now be configured to use a polyline to define intersected cells in addition to a closed polygon.

## Performance Tools and Improvements
- When working with multiple large grid models, it is possible to run into low memory issues. The memory consumption of ResInsight can be monitored using the new [Memory Report Dialog]({{< relref "memorymanagement" >}}) . This will display the consumed memory for all cases in the project.

- Avoid allocation of formations data if no formations are present
- Added support for export of application [log messages to file]({{< relref "preferences" >}}#importexport) in addition to the **Messages Window**.
