ResInsight 2018.11 is the latest version of ResInsight, the professional quality, open source 3D visualization, curve plotting and post-processing tool for Eclipse reservoir models. Version 2018.11 contains a larger number of new and exciting features, some of which are listed below.

## Local Grid Refinement (LGR)

Local Grid Refinement (LGR) can be created based on Eclipse simulations. The refined grids can also be visualised in 3D.

See [Completions LGR]({{< relref "completionslgr" >}})

## Well Path Creation
![Well Path Creation]({{< relref "" >}}images/introduction/WellPathCreation.png)

ResInsight lets the user create new/custom well paths by clicking in the 3D view. A self-established well path will behave in the same way as a regular imported well path.

See [Create Well Paths]({{< relref "createnewwellpaths" >}})

## Contour Maps

ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D map.

See [Contour Maps]({{< relref "contourmaps" >}})

## Summary Plotting

## Well Bore Stability Plots and Casing Design
![Well Bore Stability Plots]({{< relref "" >}}images/introduction/WellBoreStabilityPlots.png)

ResInsight can create **Well Bore Stability** plots for Geomechanical cases. These plots are specialized **Well Log Plots** and contain a visualization of Formations, Well Path Attributes as well as a set of well path derived curves in two different tracks.

See [Well Bore Stability Plots]({{< relref "wellborestabilityplots" >}})

## Memory Management

ResInsight can require a considerable amount of memory to hold all the grids and necessary result variables. A Memory Management system is now in place to help the user if available memory is low.

See [Memory Management]({{< relref "memorymanagement" >}})
