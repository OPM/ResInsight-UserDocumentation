The **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** lets developers install a Linux distribution and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

ResInsight has been successfully installed and used on **Ubuntu** in **WSL**. The installation is similar to the **Linux** installation. The desktop application can be launced from the **WSL** command line, and the user interface will show up on the **Windows** desktop.
