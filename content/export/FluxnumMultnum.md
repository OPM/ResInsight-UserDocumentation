The visible cells can be exported as a FLUXNUM or MULTNUM keyword that can be used in an Eclipse input data deck. 

You can do this by using the command **Export Visible Cells as FLUXNUM/MULTNUM** found by right clicking:

- **View** in the Project Tree.
- **Cell Result** in the Project Tree.
- In any Eclipse **3D View**.

The command can also be found in **File -> Export**. If the command is used in the project tree, the visible cells from the selected view are used for calculation. In the 3D view and from File -> Export, the visible cells from the currently active 3D view are used.
