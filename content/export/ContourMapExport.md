ResInsight can create [contour maps]({{< relref "contourmaps" >}}) based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D Plane. Any 3D result value can be aggregated, in addition to specialised results, such as oil, gas and hydrocarbon columns. A Contour Map is a specialised 2D view with many of the same features as the 3D views, including property filters, range filters and display of faults and wells. 


## Export of Contour Map Data

To export a contour map, invoke one of the following options (c.f. figure above):

- Select right-click command **Export Contour Map to text** in the graphics window showing a contour map.
- Select right-click command **Export Contour Map to text** for a contour map in the **Project Tree**

This initiates the following dialog for export options:

As seen, the dialog facilitates the following options: 

- Setting the file name for export.
- Export of local coordinates, i.e. coordinates measured from local origo defined in lower, left corner of contour map. Default is export of full UTM coordinates.
- Defining a text label to exclude undefined values. Default label is *NaN*.
- Exclude undefined values based on the given label. 



## Export file format

The file format for export of contour maps supports use of Python and numpy. For instance, an exported file may can be imported into numpy using the *loadtxt()* function. 

Metadata is included as comments in the beginning of the file. The character *#* as first character denotes a comment line.

If local coordinates are exported, the UTM coordinate offset is included as a comment in the header of the export file (c.f. example file below).
To anonymize the data, the UTM coordinate offset may be removed from file.

Example file:
```txt
# case name : 1_R001_REEK-0
# sampling points : nx=90 ny=100
# time and date : 01.Jan 2000
# property name : Arithmetic Mean, PRESSURE
# UTM offset : x=456256 y=5.92663e+06

x               y               value

## Python interface for export of contour maps

The [ResInsight Python API](https://api.resinsight.org) allows the user to access all contour maps belonging to a project.
A Python script for exporting contour maps to a text file is included as one of the examples of the
[ResInsight Python API](https://api.resinsight.org).
