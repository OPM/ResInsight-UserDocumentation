ResInsight offers a built-in property calculator for grid parameters. 
The **Grid Property Calculator** enables arithmetic expressions to be parsed and calculated for visualization purposes. The expression can be applied to one or multiple grid models, and the expression text can be stored to a file for later use.

Expressions can be saved to a text file using the **Export Calculations** button. The default location for calculations can be set in **Preference->Import/Export**.

More details on mathematical operations are described in [Calculator Expressions]({{< ref "CalculatorExpressions.md" >}})

## Invoking the Grid Property Calculator

Invoke the the **Grid Property Calculator** by pressing the calculator icon {{< image-in-text src="images/Calculator.svg" >}} in the menu bar or by right-clicking 
{{< image-in-text src="images/3d-main-window/CellResult.png" >}} **Cell Result** in **Project Tree**.

## Example using Grid Property Calculator
As shown, the **Grid Property Calculator** is invoked by right-clicking 
{{< image-in-text src="images/3d-main-window/CellResult.png" >}} **Cell Result** in **Project Tree**.
As seen below, the **Grid Property Calculator** is per default prefilled with the simple summation 
*Calculation_1 := x + y*. 
This simple summation suffices for exemplifying its use.
However, you may change name of the calculation and add additional variables and arithmetic operators in the **Expression** field.

**If** statements are also supported with the following syntax `NEW_TRANX := if((TRANX < 0.01), 0.01, TRANX)`
{{% /notice %}}

The next step is to define the variables *x* and *y*. 
An easy way to define each variable is to drag and drop properties from **Data Sources**. See screenshot below for drag and drop of *SOIL* from **Data Sources** to the row of variable *x* in **Grid Property Calculator** (emphasized in red). 
Continue with drag and drop of *SGAS* to define *y*.

Finally, press **Calculate** to perform the actual calculation. 

The calculated result is accessable via **Property Editor** as **Type** ***Generated*** **Result Property**.

## Reference Procedure using Grid Property Calculator

1. Invoke the the **Grid Property Calculator** by right-clicking 
{{< image-in-text src="images/3d-main-window/CellResult.png" >}} **Cell Result** in **Project Tree**.
1. Define the expression for calculation by the involved variables and arithmetic operators
   - Type the name of calculation, required variables and aritmetic operators into **Expression**
   - Press button **Parse Expression** to verify the expression and referrals to actual variables
1. Define each actual variable referred by the expression, either manually or by drag and drop from **Data Sources**
1. Press **Calculate** to perform the actual calculation
1. Access the calculated result in **Property Editor** as **Type** ***Generated*** **Result Property**
