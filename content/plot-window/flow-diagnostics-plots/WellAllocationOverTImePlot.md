**Well Allocation Over Time Plot** is a plot displaying the flow data of [Well Allocation Plots]({{% relref "flow-diagnostics-plots" %}}#well-allocation-plots) over a range of time steps. The plot provides the union of wells existing across all time steps for the selected case. 

The plot utilize the *Flow Diagnostics* to provide an overview of which well or phase contributes most to the flow in a selected well. One can e.g. see which injectors are contributing to production of a producing well, and vice versa, over the selected time step range. The plot can be configured with a *From* and *To* time step to create the defined time step range. One can either utilize all time steps in the defined range, or one can down sample the date resolution by defining a number of time steps to utilize. Specific time steps flow values can be excluded by selection - the flow rate value for next time step is then utilized for calculations for excluded time step.

The **Plot Type** can either be **Allocation** or **Well Flow**. *Allocation* shows flow data for wells contributing to the flow of the selected *Well*, whereas *Well Flow* shows the flow data for contributing phases (*Oil*, *Water* and *Gas*) for the selected *Well*.

The data values are controlled by **Value Type**, where one can select between: 
- *Flow Rates* - [$m^{3}/day$] The flow rate at each time step.
- *Flow Rate percentage* - [$\text{%}$] The flow rate contribution in percentage of total flow rate at each time step.
- *Flow Volumes* - [$m^{3}$] The flow volume between a time step and previous time step (flow rate multiplied with days between time steps).
- *Accumulated Flow Volumes* - [$m^{3}$] The flow volume accumulated for each time step.
- *Accumulated Flow Volume Percentage* - [$\text{%}$] The flow volume accumulated for each time step in percentage of total accumulated flow volume at time step.

Note that flow rates and flow volume is constant for a time step and back in time to previous time step in the selected time step range. Accumulated flow volume values are linear interpolated from the respective time step and to previous time step. Small contributors can be grouped into **Other** by enabling grouping and setting a **Threshold** value.

Further plot configuration is performed by use of the **Property Editor**, shown below.

## Creating Well Allocation Over Time Plot

The Well Allocation Over Time Plot is a part of the *Flow Diagnostics Plots*. Click [here]({{% relref "flow-diagnostics-plots" %}}#creating-well-allocation-plots) for how to generate the plots from 3D view.

## Editing Table

The settings for the Well Allocation Over Time Plot is listed in the *Property Editor*.

The main controls for a Well Allocation Over Time Plot is listed below:

#### Plot Data
- **Case** - Select case to retrieve data from.
- **Well** - Which case well to calculate *Flow Diagnostics* over time for.

#### Time Step
- **From Time Step** - Select time step to start range from.
- **To Time Step** - Select time step to end range on.
- **Filter** - Filter number of time steps to include: **Show All Time Steps** or **Time Step Count**.
- **Number of Time Steps** - Set number of time steps to include between **From** and **To** selection.
- **Exclude Time Steps** - Exclude specific time step if wanted (utilize flow rate value for next time step).

#### Options
- **Plot Type** - Select between **Allocation** or **Well Flow**.
- **Value Type** - Select between: *Flow Rates*, *Flow Rate percentage*, *Flow Volumes*, *Accumulated Flow Volumes* and *Accumulated Flow Volume Percentage*
- **Group Small Contributions** - Enable to group small contributors in category **Other**
- **Threshold** - [$0, 1$] Contributor values below threshold is grouped into category **Other** when grouping is enabled.
