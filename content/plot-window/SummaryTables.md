**Summary Tables** are a display of curve data based on [Eclipse Summary Data]({{< relref "eclipsesummarydata" >}}) as a color map in table format. It shows summary data of vectors for the selectable categories: *Well*,  *Group* or *Region*.

Summary tables are displayed with the summary vectors on each row, and time step values according to selected *Date Resampling* in each column - as shown with resampling *Year* in the screenshot above.

The table can be formatted by use of the **Property Editor**, shown below. Columns are controlled by the selection of resampling, and rows are controlled by selected *Threshold* value and *Exclude Rows*. 

## Creating Summary Tables

### Using Data Sources to create Summary Tables
Having imported [Eclipse Summary Data]({{< relref "eclipsesummarydata" >}}), [**Data Sources**]({{< relref "summaryplotdatasources" >}}) provides an easy approach to create Summary Tables:

- Search or navigate **Data Sources** to find the desired source and vector
- *Right-click* selected vector and select **New Summary Table**

### Duplicate Summary Table
When a Summary Table is created and configured, the table can be duplicated by *Right-click* on the respective table in the [Project Tree]({{< relref "projecttree" >}}) and selecting **Duplicate Summary Table**. This creates a new Summary Table with the same configuration, and a new table can be created with minor adjustments in the *Property Editor*.

### Create default Summary Table
A default Summary Table can be created by *Right-click* on the Summary Table collection and select **New Summary Table**. This creates a new default Summary Table, which can be configured by selections in the *Property Editor*

## Editing Summary Table

The settings of each table is listed in the *Property Editor* for a Summary Table. By selecting a Summary Table, its properties are displayed.

The main controls for a Summary Table is listed below:

- **Category** - Select which category to select vectors from: *Well*, *Group* or *Region*.
- **Vector** - Selection of vector type available for selected category in case.
- **Date Resampling** - Select date resampling to control number data values for each vector - i.e. number of columns. The resampling is ensuring equal time stamps across all summary vectors in table.
- **Threshold** - Set threshold value for summary vector. Exclude row (vector) if each time stamp value are below selected threshold.
- **Exclude Rows** - Select which rows (vectors) to exclude from the table.
- **Time Filter** - Define the visible time range
