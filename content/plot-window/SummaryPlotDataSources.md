**Data Sources** provides an overview of all data sources for summary plots by category to provide search, selection, and essential functionality pertinent to summary cases. 

As seen above, **Data Sources** enables search and sourcing of data from case, field, regions, wells, groups, or ensemble.
See [Summary Plots]({{< relref "summaryplots" >}}) which illustrates use of **Data Sources** for effective search and selection of data for summary plots.


## Searching for data sources
Atop the **Data Sources** window, there is a search field for effective searches across all available data sources. As exemplified below, typing just a few letters initiates a search for vectors prefixed by *wbh* across all data groups listing all hits.

## Summary Cases functionality
Right-clicking the **Summary Cases** entry in **Data Sources** displays the functionality pertinent to summary cases.

### Delta Summary Case and Delta Ensemble
A **Delta Summary Case** or **Delta Ensemble** can be created as either the sum or difference between two existing summary cases or ensembles, respectively.

To create a delta summary case, for instance, right click and select **New Delta Summary Case**. 
The Property Editor for the new delta case allows to modify display name, the two base summary cases, and the arithmetic operator.
In addition, it is possible to specify a specific time step to be used in delta computation.
As exemplified below, the delta computation between two cases for a given parameter, e.g. *WBHP*, will be:
$$WBHP\_{delta}(t) = WBHP\_{case1}(@02.01.2000) - WBHP\_{case2}(t)$$
An existing delta summary case may be input to a new delta summary case.

### Curve calculator
The [Curve Calculator]({{< relref "curvecalculator" >}})
is a tool to perform vector calculations on a set of curves. The created curves can be stored for later use.



## Summary Case functionality
Right-clicking a specific *Summary Case* in **Data Sources** displays the functionality pertinent to a single summary case.

The highlighted menu item, right-clicking a summary case in **Data Sources** and select *Replace* will redisplay all configured plots with data from another case.

Please also note the menu options to create summary plot from [Template]({{< relref "summaryplottemplate" >}}) which is a powerful and effective way to create summary plots with a specific appearance and content. When invoking a well-specific template on Summary Case level as shown above, the convention is that ResInsight selects the first well listed under {{< image-in-text src="images/plot-window/DataSourcesWell.png" >}} as data source.
