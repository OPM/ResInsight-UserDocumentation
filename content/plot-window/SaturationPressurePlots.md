A Saturation Pressure Plot a plot displaying bubble and dew point pressures, together with initial pressure in model, versus depth. Fluid contacts (GOC and/or OWC) are displayed as annotation lines in the generated plots. One Saturation Pressure Plot is created for each equilibrium region.

To be able to create these plots, output of saturation pressures need to be specified in the **SOLUTION** section of the Eclipse ".DATA" file.
