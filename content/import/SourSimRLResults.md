ResInsight is able to import transient results from the simulation software SourSimRL to combine reservoir souring simulation data with an Eclipse case for analysis and visualization. 
Results from SourSimRL in its *sourres* binary format can be imported using the **SourSim File Name** field as shown below:

![]({{< relref "" >}}images/import/soursim_import.PNG) 

Importing such a file will enable result type called **SourSimRL** as explained in [Eclipse Result Types]({{< ref "cellresults.md#eclipse-result-types" >}})
