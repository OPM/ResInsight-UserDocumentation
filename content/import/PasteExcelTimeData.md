When text have been copied to the operating system's clipboard, it will be possible to paste that text into a summary plot. Right click on a summary plot in the **Plot Main Window Project Tree** and select **Paste Excel Data to Summary Plot**. Then a paste options dialog will appear.

## Paste Options Dialog
![](/images/import/PasteExcelData.png)

Most of the fields in this dialog are the same as in the [CSV/txt import options dialog]({{< relref "observeddata" >}}#csv-txt-import-options-dialog). Please see that section for documentation on those fields. The fields specific to the paste options dialog are as follows:

- **Curve Prefix** -- Curve name prefix for all curves created from the pasted data.
- **Line Style** -- Line style to use for the curves created from the pasted data.
- **Symbol** -- Line symbol to use for each data point on the curves created from the pasted data.
- **Symbol Skip Distance** -- Minimum distance between two adjacent symbols on the curves. If two data points on a curve is closer than the specified distance, a symbol is not drawn for one of the data points. Default value is 0, which will draw a symbol at all data points on the curves regardless of the distance between data points.
