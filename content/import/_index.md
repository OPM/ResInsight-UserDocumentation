ResInsight is able to import a wide span of Eclipse files, seismic data files, and ROFF grid models.

For import of Eclipse data pertinent to summary vectors and well log data, see 
[Plot Window]({{< relref "plot-window/_index.md" >}}).

ResInsight can be built with support for geomechanical models from ABAQUS and is also able to import 
transient reservoir souring data from the SourSimRL simulation software.

In addition, ResInsight supports import of property tables in ABQUS input file format, observed time history data, and pasting time history data into a summary plot as described in the subsequent subchapters.
