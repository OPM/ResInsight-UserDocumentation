A grid model can be imported from several sources, either **Eclipse** binary/ascii or **ROFF** binary/ascii. Grid properties in separate files can be imported into any grid type as long as the number of grid cells is matching.

**Appending properties**
1. From the right-click menu of the case or Cell Result, select **Add Input Property**
2. Select the file with properties
3. The imported data is then available in the **Cell Result** by activating the **Input Property** in the **Type** drop down list.
