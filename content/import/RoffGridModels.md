ResInsight supports the following type of **ROFF** input data:

- _`*.ROFF`_ and _`*.ROFFASC`_ containing data from **RMS** as Roxar Open File Format (ROFF) in binary or ascii format.


## Roff Data

Roff Data can be imported from **File->Import->Roff Grid Models->Import Roff Case** menu. Select a grid file and additional files with properties in the import dialog. The grid will be displayed and used in the same way as an Eclipse grid model.
