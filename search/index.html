<script>window.store=[],window.store["/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/getting-started/overview/"]={title:"Overview",content:`User Interface ResInsight has two main windows, one for 3D related visualizations and one for 2D graphs and plots.
3D Main Window Plot Main Window Switching Between the Two Main Windows The two main windows has a toolbar button each, that directly opens and raises the other window. Each of the windows can also be closed freely, but if both are closed, ResInsight exits.
Docking Windows Each of the main windows has a central area and several docking windows surrounding it. The different docking windows can be managed from the Windows menu or directly using the local menu bar of the docking window.
Project Tree &ndash; contains all application objects in a tree structure. Property Editor &ndash; displays all properties for the selected object in the Project Tree Process Monitor &ndash; displays output from Octave when executing Octave scripts Result Info &ndash; displays info for the selected object in the 3D scene Result Plot &ndash; displays curves based on result values for the selected cells in the 3D scene Messages &ndash; displays occasional info and warnings related to operations executed. Result Info and Result Plot is described in detail in Result Inspection Use several Project Trees and Property Editors: If you want to pin the property editor for a certain object, you can add a new Project Tree and Property Editor by using the command Windows-&gt;New Project and Property View.
Toolbars A selected subset of actions are presented as controls in the toolbar. The different sections in the toolbar can be dragged and positioned anywhere as small floating toolbars. Management of the toolbar is done by right-clicking on the toolbar and then manipulating the displayed menu.
Managing 3D Views and Plot Windows In the main area of the application, several 3D views or plot windows can be open at the same time. One of them will be active and the active view can be either maximized to use the whole main area, or restored so that you can see the open windows.
Standard window management for applying minimized, normal and maximized state is available in the upper right corner.
Commands to arrange the windows in the standard ways are available from the Windows menu
Tile Windows &ndash; distribute all open view windows to fill available view widget space The order of the tiled windows are determined by the window positions and the type of view at the time of running the tile command. The leftmost window are tiled first, then the next leftmost and so on. Master views are tiled before slave views. Cascade Windows &ndash; organize all open view windows slightly offset on top of each other Close All Windows &ndash; close all open view windows Editing 3D Views and Plot Windows Content Most of the settings and features of ResInsight is accessible through the Project Tree and the Property Editor. Selecting an item in the Project Tree activates the corresponding Window, and shows the item properties in the Property Editor available for editing.
Toggling a checkbox next to an item in the Project Tree will toggle visibility in the window. Toggling a checkbox for a collection of items will affect the visibility for all items in the collection . Right-click menu commands are also available to do special operations on a selected set of items.
ResInsight stores all views and settings in a Project File to easily continue the work in a subsequent session.
Model Navigation describes how to interact and manipulate the 3D model.
Cases and Their Types A Case in ResInsight means a Grid model with a particular set of results or property data. There are three different types of Eclipse cases and one type of Geomechanical cases.
Eclipse Cases The following Eclipse cases can be imported into ResInsight via the File-&gt;Import-&gt;Eclipse Cases menu, see Import Eclipse Cases:
Result Case This is a Case based on the results of an Eclipse simulation, read from a grid file together with static and restart data. Multiple Cases can be selected and read from a folder.
Input Case This Case type is based on a *.GRDECL file, or a part of an Eclipse Input file. This Case type supports loading single ASCII files defining Eclipse Cell Properties, and also to export modified property sets to ASCII files. Each of the Eclipse properties are listed as separate entities in the Project Tree, and can be renamed and exported. See Grid Import and Property Export Statistics Case This is a Case type that belongs to a Grid Case Group and makes statistical calculations based on the source cases in the Grid Case Group. See Grid Case Groups and Statistics .
Summary Case This is the case type listed in the Plot Main Window, and represents an *.SMSPEC file. These Cases are available for Summary Plotting. See Summary Plots .
Geomechanical cases There are only one type of geomechanical cases, namely the ABAQUS-odb case type. When ResInsight is compiled with ABAQUS-odb support, *.odb files can be imported by selecting the menu item: File-&gt;Import-&gt;Geo Mechanical Cases-&gt; Import Geo Mechanical Model.
The geomechanical cases are sorted into its own folder in the project tree named Geomechanical Models as opposed to the Grid Models folder where the Eclipse cases and Grid Case Groups resides.
See Build Instructions on how to compile ResInsight with odb-support.
Grid Case Groups A Grid Case Group is a group of Eclipse Result Cases with identical grids, but generally different active cells, initial values and results. These cases are called Source Cases. The purpose of a Grid Case group is to make it easy to calculate statistics across the source cases both for static and dynamic Eclipse Properties. See Grid Case Groups and Statistics .

As described in Overview, ResInsight has two main windows, one for 3D related visualizations and one for 2D graphs and plots. The content and appearance of displayed information is managed and controlled by the Project Tree and the Plots windows. Some of their general functionality is described and exemplified below.
Multiple selection and collective actions Multiple selection of items in ResInsight offers an entrance to powerful combinations and collective actions. To exemplify, consider the plot of Bottom Hole Pressure for a number of wells atop this page. By multi-selection in Plots, you may for instance change the color of multiple curves as shown below.
Several options are available for multi selection of items which can be used in combination for efficiency and convenience:
Ctrl + left mouse button for selecting individual items Shift + left mouse button for selecting a range of consecutive items Item right-click menu: offers context sensitive actions, e.g.: Sub Items On: select all sub-items of an item Sub Items Off: deselect all sub-items of an item Toggle Sub Items: deselect previously selected sub-items and select previously not selected sub-items On - Others Off: Turns on selected plot and turns off all other plots Context sensitive help ResInsight offers context sensitive help for any item in project tree. Most convenient is just to press the F1 help key for any selected item. Alternatively, you may right-click an item and invoke menu item Search Help For.

`,url:"/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/getting-started/projecttree/"},window.store["/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/3d-main-window/3dviews/"]={title:"3D Views",content:`
3D Views are the windows displaying the Grid Models. The visualization is controlled by the Project Tree item representing the View and their sub items.
Each item has a set of properties that can be edited in the Property Editor.
Several views can be added to the same case by right-clicking the case or a view and select New View. You can also Copy and then Paste a view into a Case. All the settings are then copied to the new view.
Views of Eclipse models and Geomechanical models has a lot in common, but Eclipse views has some features that applies to Eclipse simulations only.
Common view features View properties Grid appearance can be controlled from the Property Editor when a view is selected. This includes background color and z scaling. In addition, cell visibility controls of inactive and invalid cells.
Visibility of the grid box with labels displaying the coordinates for the reservoir can also be controlled using Show Grid Box.
Cell Result The Cell Result item defines which Eclipse or Geomechanical property the 3D View uses for the main cell color. The property can be chosen in the property panel of the Cell Result item. The mapping between cell values and color is defined by the Legend Definition along with some appearance settings on the Legend itself. (Number format etc.)
Please refer to Result Color Legend for details.
Range Filters and Property Filters In order to see different sets of cells, and cells inside the reservoir, Views use cell filters. Please refer to Cell Filters to read more about them.
Info Box The Info Box controls the visibility of the animation progress, the Case description box, and the results histogram displayed in the top right corner of the view.
The Animation Progress shows which time step you are viewing.
The Info Text shows general info about the case, the selected results, and some statistics. Mobile Volume Weighted Mean is the mean of the current Cell Property weighted by the Mobile pore volume. Mobile pore volume is defined in every cell as: MULTPV * PORV(1-SWCR). If MULTPV data is not present, it is ignored in the equation. The same applies to SWCR data.
The Histogram shows a histogram of the complete time series of the currently loaded Cell Result together with:
The mean value ( a blue line ) P10 and P90 ( red lines ) Statistics Options Statistics Time Range &ndash; controls whether all time steps or only the current time step are included when statistics is computed. Flow Diagnostic results can only use the current time step option. Statistics Cell Range &ndash; controls if visible cells or all active cells is included when statistics is computed. The Info Box settings can be activated by clicking on the Info Text in the 3D view.
Grids The Grids node contains child nodes for Main Grid, LGRs and Temporary LGRs where each grid&rsquo;s visibilty can be controlled. The LGRs node contains all LGRs loaded from file, while Temporary LGRs contains all temporary LGRs (see Completions LGR). Toggling Grids off will hide all grids cell geometry. This option is used to display geometry for faults and intersections. This feature is also available as a toolbutton called Hide grid cells.
Intersections Intersections are used to cut the geometry and show result values mapped onto this geometry. Please refer to Intersections for details.
Activate items by clicking Selected overlay items in the 3D view can activate a corresponding item in the Property Editor. This is implemented for Info box and result color legends. Please note that this feature is activated by clicking inside the texture/colored part of the legend.
Eclipse features Cell Edge Results The Cell Edge Result visualization mode is one of ResInsight&rsquo;s special features. Its main use is to show the MULT(X, Y, Z) properties at the same time. This will show the MULT property values different from 1.0 along the correct edges of the cells. In effect this highlights the faults and makes it easy to verify all the MULT values in one go.
ResInsight supports all properties ending with X, Y, Z and X-, Y-, Z-. However, it is only the MULT property that ignores values of 1.0.
When selecting a result variable for cell edge, a second legend shows up in the 3D view showing the variation in values for this second property. Color legend management is available when selecting the Legend Definition item belonging to the Cell Edge Result item.
Select Custom Edge Result to specify one cell result to be mapped onto all cell edges. This way two cell results can easily be compared and visualized in the same view. The Custom Edge Result can either be a static or dynamic result.
Separate Fault Result Default result mapping on faults is using the result specified in Cell Result. If a different result mapping is wanted, enable the checkbox and select the result from the result selection dialog in the Property Editor. A second legend for the fault result is added to the view.
Simulation Wells This item controls the visualization of the Eclipse simulation wells. Please refer to Simulation Wells to read more.
Well Connection Factors This item controls the visualization of well connection factors. See Visualization and Inspection of Well Connection Factors for details.
Fractures This item controls the visualization of fractures. See Fractures for details.
Faults Visualization of the faults in the model is controlled by this item. Please refer to Faults to read more.

<h3 id="info-box">Info Box</h3>
<p>The <strong>Info Box</strong> controls the visibility of the animation progress, the Case description box, and the results histogram displayed in the top right corner of the view.</p>
<p>The <strong>Animation Progress</strong> shows which time step you are viewing.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/AnimationProgress.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <strong>Info Text</strong> shows general info about the case, the selected results, and some statistics. <strong>Mobile Volume Weighted Mean</strong> is the mean of the current <strong>Cell Property</strong> weighted by the <strong>Mobile pore volume</strong>. Mobile pore volume is defined in every cell as: MULTPV <em>*</em> PORV(1-SWCR). If MULTPV data is not present, it is ignored in the equation. The same applies to SWCR data.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/infoBox.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <strong>Histogram</strong> shows a histogram of the complete time series of the currently loaded <strong>Cell Result</strong> together with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean value ( a blue line )</li>
<li>P10 and P90 ( red lines )</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="statistics-options">Statistics Options</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statistics Time Range</strong> &ndash; controls whether all time steps or only the current time step are included when statistics is computed. Flow Diagnostic results can only use the current time step option.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics Cell Range</strong> &ndash; controls if visible cells or all active cells is included when statistics is computed.</li>

 node contains child nodes for <strong>Main Grid</strong>, <strong>LGRs</strong> and <strong>Temporary LGRs</strong> where each grid&rsquo;s visibilty can be controlled. The <strong>LGRs</strong> node contains all LGRs loaded from file, while <strong>Temporary LGRs</strong> contains all temporary LGRs (see <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/wells-and-completions/completionslgr/">Completions LGR</a>).
Toggling <strong>Grids</strong> off will hide all grids cell geometry. This option is used to display geometry for faults and intersections. This feature is also available as a toolbutton called <em>Hide grid cells</em>.</p>
<h3 id="intersections">Intersections</h3>
<p>Intersections <img src="https://opm.github.io/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/CrossSections16x16.png" style="display:inline; vertical-align:middle; margin:0">
 are used to cut the geometry and show result values mapped onto this geometry.

<p>The <strong>Cell Edge Result</strong> <img src="https://opm.github.io/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/EdgeResult_1.png" style="display:inline; vertical-align:middle; margin:0">
 visualization mode is one of ResInsight&rsquo;s special features. Its main use is to show the MULT(X, Y, Z) properties at the same time. This will show the MULT property values <em>different from 1.0</em> along the correct edges of the cells. In effect this highlights the faults and makes it easy to verify all the MULT values in one go.</p>
<p>ResInsight supports all properties ending with X, Y, Z and X-, Y-, Z-. However, it is only the MULT property that ignores values of 1.0.</p>
<p>When selecting a result variable for cell edge, a second legend shows up in the 3D view showing the variation in values for this second property. Color legend management is available when selecting the <strong>Legend Definition</strong> item belonging to the <strong>Cell Edge Result</strong> item.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Custom Edge Result</strong> to specify one cell result to be mapped onto all cell edges. This way two cell results can easily be compared and visualized in the same view. The <strong>Custom Edge Result</strong> can either be a static or dynamic result.</p>
<h3 id="separate-fault-result">Separate Fault Result</h3>
<p>Default result mapping on faults is using the result specified in <strong>Cell Result</strong>. If a different result mapping is wanted, enable the checkbox and select the result from the result selection dialog in the <strong>Property Editor</strong>. A second legend for the fault result is added to the view.</p>

`,url:"/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/getting-started/download-and-install/"},window.store["/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/import/eclipsecases/"]={title:"Eclipse Cases",content:`ResInsight supports the following type of Eclipse input data:
*.GRID and *.EGRID files along with their *.INIT and restart files *.XNNN and *.UNRST. Grid and Property data from *.GRDECL files. Release 2018.11 supports import of simulations from Intersect. To be able to import into ResInsight, the Intersect simulation must be exported into Eclipse file format.
Eclipse Results ResInsight offers several ways to import Eclipse (grid) files. Use one of the following commands in the File-&gt;Import-&gt;Eclipse Cases menu:
Import Eclipse Case: Brings up the standard file selection dialog. Select *.EGRID or *.GRID Eclipse files for import. Multiple selections are allowed. Import Eclipse Cases Recursively: Brings up the recursive file selection dialog. This dialog is described in detail on the Summary Plots page. Import Eclipse Case (Time Step Filtered): See description Import Input Eclipse Case: See description Create Grid Case Group : Import a number of Eclipse files and places the cases in a grid case group See File Selection Dialog for how to import multiple files. The Reload Case command can be used to reload a previously imported case, to make sure it is up to date. This is useful if the grid or result files changes while a ResInsight session is active.
You can select several grid files in one go by multiple selection of files (Ctrl + left mouse button, Shift + left mouse button).
Result Index File If enabled, ResInsight will generate an index file when reading the eclipse result files for the first time. This file will significantly reduce the time used to open the case next time. The file is named &lt;casename&gt;.RESINSIGHT_IDX See Preferences: Behavior When Loading Data
Time Step Filtered Eclipse Result Some Eclipse files have an enormous amount of time steps. If only a selection of the time steps really are needed for the session, the time steps can be filtered before loading. This can possibly speed up the import a great deal. Filtering can be done in the following way.
Select File-&gt;Import-&gt;Eclipse Cases-&gt; Import Eclipse Case (Time Step Filtered) and select an *.EGRID or *.GRID Eclipse file for import. A dialog will appear.
Filtering can be done by adjusting the following parameters:
First and last time step Step filter type and with step interval size First and last time step to include in the import can be chosen in their respective drop down list. All time steps found in the file are included in both lists.
Filter Type is set to All by default. This means that all time steps between the first and last chosen time step will be imported. The alternative to All is to skip time steps in a number of Days, Weeks, Months, Quarters or Years. The skipping interval is set in the text field below. After editing the Interval field, press tab to update the Filtered Time Steps preview, or click anywhere in the dialog. Click Ok to import when the filter is ready.
Filtering can also be done after import, in a case&rsquo;s Property Window.
After clicking Reload Case, the time steps in the toolbar will be updated.
Eclipse ASCII Input Data Select File-&gt;Import-&gt;Eclipse Cases-&gt; Import Input Eclipse Case and select a *.GRDECL file. The case is imported, and a view of the case is created Right-click the Input Properties in the generated Input Case and use the right-click menu to import additional Eclipse Property data files. Appending additional properties to a binary case If a binary or text Eclipse case is loaded, additional properties can be appended to this binary case. Make sure that the number of values in the GRDECL file matches the total number of cells in the binary case.
Appending Additional Properties
For export of currently selected cell result values to text file, see Export: Eclipse Properties
Handling Missing or Wrong MAPAXES The X and Y grid data can be negated in order to make the Grid model appear correctly in ResInsight. This functionality is accessible in the Property Editor for all Eclipse Case types as the toggle buttons Flip X Axis and Flip Y Axis as shown in the example below.

Basic Summary Import Summary data is located in two files, summary vector names in *.SMSPEC and curve data in *.UNSMRY.
For import of ensemble datasets, see Ensemble File Dialog.
Origin Files During summary file import, ResInsight checks whether the summary file is restarted, i.e. has an origin file. If an origin file is found, the Origin Files dialog is displayed.
Depending on what triggered the summary file import, the dialog shows slightly different information. If the summary file import was triggered by a grid file import, the dialog displays information about grid files in addition to the summary origin file(s). If the summary file was imported directly, information about grid files are not relevant and thus not displayed.
The dialog contents are organized in groups:
Current Grid and Summary Files or Current Summary Files: This group displays the name of the main summary file to import. If the import is triggered by a grid file import, the name of the grid file is also displayed. Origin Summary Files: This group displays the names of the origin summary file(s) found. If there are more than one file listed, it means that the found origin file also has an origin file. ResInsight will search the &ldquo;chain&rdquo; of summary origin files until it reaches the end. Import Options There are three options to control how origin summary file are imported Unified: The main summary files and all origin files are imported into one single summary case Separate Cases: The main files and all origin files are imported into separate summary cases Skip: Only the main summary file is imported. The origin summary files are skipped. Origin Grid Files: If the summary file import was triggered by a grid file import, this group is visible. It contains a list of the grid files associated to the origin summary files Import Options There are two options to control how the grid files are imported Separate Cases: All &ldquo;origin&rdquo; grid files are imported into separate grid cases Skip: Only the main grid file is imported. The &ldquo;origin&rdquo; grid files are skipped. By default the file names are displayed using relative path based on the common root folder for all files. In order to display the full path, check the Show full paths checkbox. Regardless of the checkbox state, there is always a tooltip showing the full path for every file. It is also possible to copy a full path file name to the clipboard. Right click on the file name and select Copy file name.
If the user selected multiple summary files or grid files, this dialog will be displayed for every file that has an origin summary file. In this case the button OK to All appears. When this button is clicked, the rest of the files will be imported silently using the same options.
Naming The name of a summary case can be changed by interactive edit of the name in the Project Tree (by clicking or using F2) or selecting the summary case in the Property Editor and edit the name.
Summary Data File Formats ResInsight is able to import summary data in several file formats. Default exported by Eclipse is *.SMSPEC/.UNSMRY.
For best performance, consider using the ESMRY File Format.
SMSPEC/UNSMRY File Format Eclipse will by default export summary data to *.SMSPEC and *.UNSMRY. Data is organized by simulation time step and extraction of data for one summary vector can be time consuming for large data sets.
ESMRY File Format *.ESMRY files contains the same data as SMSPEC/UNSMRY. The data in these files are organized in a different way that will give significantly better performance when accessing single summary vectors compared to SMSPEC/UNSMRY.
ResInsight will by default use this file format.
h5 File Format Eclipse is able to produce summary data in a file format with the extension *.H5 with the same content as *.UNSMRY.

If the interesting files are distributed over multiple directories, the dialog has to be opened once for each directory. The recursive file selection dialog is created to circumvent this limitation. This dialog is able to search a directory tree for files matching a specified pattern.
This dialog is used for import of different file types like *.EGRID, *.SMSPEC, *.TS, *.GRDECL, &hellip;
The dialog consists of the following fields:
Path Pattern: The path filter uses normal wildcard file globbing, like in any unix shell. When the filter ends with a single &ldquo;**&rdquo; (eg. &ldquo;/home/*&rdquo;), however, ResInsight will search recursively in all subdirectories from that point. This is indicated by &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; in the Effective Filter label below. File Pattern: The search pattern that applies to the file name. * Matches any number of any characters except the path separator ? Matches one character exception the directory separator [abc] Matches one of the specified characters. Ex. a, b or c *[!D] Exclude files ending with the character &lsquo;D&rsquo; (file extension is not considered) File Type: The available file types will depend on the type of data to import. When importing summary data, there will be several items, and one with SMSPEC. File Extensions: List of file extensions, ie &ldquo;.EGRID .GRID&rdquo;. The extension text is independent to the file type defined above, e.g. CSV data can be imported from a file with extension &ldquo;TXT&rdquo; Use &lsquo;realization-*&rsquo; in filter : Replace the text &ldquo;realization-12&rdquo; with &ldquo;realization-*&rdquo; Ensemble grouping : Group ensemble by Main folder or Sub Folder (Used by FMU workflow) Effective Filter: The effective filter displays the resulting full path search pattern. It is updated on the fly as the user edits the pattern fields. A text string of &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; indicates a complete recursive directory search. Ensemble File Structure Multiple summary files defining an ensemble can be organized differently in folders. ResInsight support two different modes, Sub Folder and Main Folder.
Sub Folder Example folder structure
real-1/case-1 /case-2 real-2/case-1 /case-2 real-3/case-1 /case-2 Using the option Group By Sub Folder will identify case-1 and case-2 as the ensemble names. This folder structure is used by the FMU workflow.
Main Folder Example folder structure
case-1/real-1 case-1/real-2 case-1/real-3 case-2/real-1 case-2/real-2 case-2/real-3 Using the option Group By Main Folder will identify case-1 and case-2 as the ensemble names. This folder structure is used by the Everest workflow.
After pressing the Find button, a file search is performed in the root directory and the directories below matching the path pattern. The files found are presented in a list, where the user can check/uncheck each file individually.
When the OK button is pressed, all checked files are imported.

This section describes how wells defined in the simulation are displayed, and how to control the different aspects of their visualization.
Commands Several commands are available as right-click commands on a simulation well. These commands are available either by right-clicking the well in the 3D View or in the Project Tree.
New Well Log Extraction Curve &ndash; Creates a new Well Log curve based on the selected simulation well, the current time step and cell property. ( See Well Log Plots ) New Well Log RFT Curve &ndash; Creates a new RFT curve in a well log plot based on the selected simulation well. This option is only present if the current simulation well has RFT data. ( See Well Log Plots ) New RFT Plot &ndash; See [Well Log Plots](/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/plot-window/rftplot/. Plot Production Rates &ndash; Creates a summary plot of the selected wells production rates, along with the bottom hole pressure.
( See Summary Plots ) Plot Well Allocation &ndash; Creates or modifies the default Well Allocation Plot to show the well. allocation for the selected well. If the case has no Fluxes the well flow rates are shown instead.
( See Flow Diagnostics Plots ) Show Contributing Wells &ndash; This command sets up a 3D View by adding filters and modifying the Cell Result based on Flow Diagnostic Calculations to show which regions and wells that contribute to the selected well by doing: Add a property filter of Time Of Flight to/from the selected well to show only the cells that contribute to/are influenced by the well. Sets the Cell Result to show Tracer With Max Fraction based on All Injectors or All Producers (the opposite of the selected well) Toggles the visibility of the other Simulation wells to show only wells contributing to/influenced by the selected well. New Fracture &ndash; Creates a new fracture along the simulation well. (See Fracture instances) New Intersection &ndash; creates a new intersection based on the selected simulation well.
( See Well Log Plots ) Overall Settings for Simulation Wells The Property Panel of the Simulation Wells item in the Project Tree contains options that are applied across all the wells, while the visualization of each single well can be controlled by the options in the property panel of that particular well, and will override the overall settings in the Simulation Wells item.
If an option is overridden in any of the wells, this will be indicated in the corresponding top level toggle which will be partially checked. Toggling such a setting will overwrite the ones set on the individual level.
In the following are the different parts of the Simulation Wells property panel explained.
Visibility These options controls the visibility of different aspects of the simulation wells.
Wells Trough Visible Cells Only &ndash; This option will only show wells with connections to cells deemed visible by the combined result of Range Filters and Property Filters. Label &ndash; Controls visibility of well name labels in the 3D View Well head &ndash; Controls visibility of the arrow displaying the production status of the well Pipe &ndash; A symbolic pipe can be drawn between the well connection cells to illustrate the well. This option controls the visibility of the pipes. Spheres &ndash; This option toggles the visibility of spheres drawn at the center of each well connection cell. Disks &ndash; Visualization of production and injection rates and cumulative production and injection with oil, gas, and water phases. Communication Lines &ndash; Toggles the visibility of well communication lines. These arrows shows the communication between wells. Broader arrows indicate higher level of communication. These arrows are based on Flow Diagnostics calculations, and are only available if the eclipse results includes fluxes. Arrows representing communication in the opposite direction from what is expected (eg. producers supporting another well due to cross flow) are displayed in a layer &ldquo;under&rdquo; the other arrows, to make them easier to see. Well Cells and Fence Show Well Cells &ndash; This option toggles whether to add the well connection cells to the set of visible cells. If no cell filters are active, toggling this option will conveniently hide all other cells, displaying only the requested well cells. Show Well Cell Fence &ndash; This options toggles whether to add all cells in a given direction ( I, J or K) to the set of visible cells, which has a connecting cell within its set. Well Fence direction &ndash; Controls whether to add extensions of the well cells in the I, J or K direction to the set of visible cells Size Scaling Well Head Scale &ndash; Scales the arrow displaying the production status of the well Pipe Radius Scale &ndash; Scaling the pipe radius by the average i,j cell size. Sphere Radius Scale &ndash; Scaling connection cell spheres radius by the average i,j cell size. Open Simulation Wells will be drawn with a slightly larger radius than closed wells. This makes open wells easier to see when they occupy the same cells as closed ones.
Colors Color Pipe Connections &ndash; Applies a red, green, blue or gray color to the section of the pipe touching a connection cell indicating the production status of the connection. Gas injection, oil production, water injection or closed respectively. Label Color &ndash; Sets the well label color in the 3D view. Individual Pipe Colors - Select how each pipe will be colored. The Individual Pipe Color setting has two different options:
Unique Colors &ndash; Selecting this will apply unique colors from a pre-defined color palette to all the wells, overwriting the colors they had. Uniform Default Color &ndash; Selecting this will apply the same color (made available in the Uniform Well Color option to all simulation wells. Well Pipe Geometry Type &ndash; Controls whether the pipe will go from cell center to cell center or in a smoother trajectory. Branch Detection &ndash; Enables splitting of wells into branches based on the positions of the connection cells. This option applies to ordinary wells only and has no effect on multi segment wells (MSW). Advanced Well Cell Transparency &ndash; Controls the transparency level for the well cells. Well Head Position &ndash; Controls the depth position of the wellhead. Either relative to the top of the active cells in the relevant IJ-column, or relative to the highest active cell overall. Disks Disks may be used to visualize production and injection rates and cumulative production and injection with oil, gas, and water phases shown in green, red, and blue, respectively. Optionally, the quantity of production and injection can be displayed.
Display of Disks are enabled from Simulations Wells, c.f. figure below. Property Type defaults to predefined production and injection properties but also allows for selection of a single property. When showing Quantity Labels, it is often useful to also activate Show Label Background.
Individual Simulation Well options Each of the wells has a set of individual settings which corresponds to the setting on the global level. See the documentation of Overall Settings for Simulation Wells.
Except for the Size Scaling, these options will override the corresponding setting on the global level, and will result in a partially checked state on the corresponding toggle in the Simulation Wells property panel. The Size Scaling options, however, works relative to the scaling level set on the top level.
Well Pipes of Multi Segment Wells ResInsight reads the MSW information in the result files and uses that to create a topologically correct visualization of the Multi Segment Well. Valves are visulized on the pipe geometry.
Reading this information is somewhat time consuming, and can be turned off in Preferences .
Geometry Approximation If the import of MSW data is disabled, or MSW data is not present, the topology of the well is estimated. This feature works in most cases, but can generate invalid well geometry in some cases.
Picking Reveals Segment/Branch Info Branch and segment info of a MSW-connected-Cell is shown in the Result Info window when picking a cell in the 3D View. This can be handy when relating the visualization to the input files.

`,url:"/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/wells-and-completions/simulationwells/"},window.store["/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/export/snapshots/"]={title:"Snapshots",content:`ResInsight has several commands to create snapshots conveniently. 3 commands to take snapshots of existing Plot and 3D Views directly, and a more advanced export command that can automatically modify Eclipse 3D Views before snapshotting them.
Snapshots of Existing Views The commands to snapshot existing views and plots are available from the toolbar and the Edit and File-&gt;Export menus in the main windows Snapshot to Clipboard A snapshot of the active view is copied to the clipboard using Edit -&gt; Copy Snapshot To Clipboard .
Snapshot to File Image export of the currently active 3D View or Plot Window can be launched from File -&gt; Export -&gt; Snapshot To File .
Snapshot All Views/Plots to File If a project contains multiple 3D Views or Plot Windows, all of them can be exported in one go using File -&gt; Export -&gt; Snapshot All Views To File . This will either export all the 3D Views or all the Plot Windows, depending on whether you invoke the command in the 3D Main Window or the Plot Main Window.
The files generated are stored in a folder named snapshots within the folder where the Project File resides.
Snapshots of existing views can also be created and saved from the command line ( See Command Line Interface ).
Advanced Snapshot Export The Advanced Snapshot Export command is useful for exporting several images of a specified set of views while simultaneously changing some of their settings. By using this command it is easy to document all layers of a specific model, or generate images with identical setup across several different cases. It is also easy to export an image for each of the time steps in a case, or even a combination of all these parameters.
The Advanced Snapshot Export is available from the File-&gt;Export menu in the 3D Main Window Invoking the command will display the following dialog:
This table defines which 3D Views to modify, and how to modify them. Each row defines the modifications of a specific view, and for all the combinations a row specifies, a snapshot is generated.
To edit a row, the row must be activated by toggling it on in the Active column, then double click on the cell to edit.
Options represented by columns:
View &ndash; Selects the view to modify. Result Type, Properties &ndash; Defines a list of eclipse result properties to cycle through when creating snapshots. If properties from both the dynamic and static list is needed, you must create a new row. Start Time, End Time &ndash; Defines the time step range to cycle through when creating snapshots. Range Filter Slice, Range Start, Range End &ndash; Defines a range filter slice that will be added to the view, and then cycled from Range Start to Range End when creating snapshots. Cases &ndash; Defines the cases to cycle while creating snapshots. Normally you can not change which case a view is displaying, but this option does temporarily. The number of exported snapshots from a row can easily end up being huge, so it is wise to use some caution. The total number will be Properties * Time Steps * Range Steps * Cases.
Rows can be deleted and created by right-clicking in the table. 5 rows are created for convenience by default.
The snapshots will be generated and saved to the folder displayed in the Export Folder field, when pressing the Export button. This might take quite some time, depending on you settings.

<p>The <strong>Advanced Snapshot Export</strong>  <img src="https://opm.github.io/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/export/SnapShotSaveViews.png" style="display:inline; vertical-align:middle; margin:0">
 command is useful for exporting several images of a specified set of views while simultaneously changing some of their settings. By using this command it is easy to document all layers of a specific model, or generate images with identical setup across several different cases. It is also easy to export an image for each of the time steps in a case, or even a combination of all these parameters.</p>
<p>The <strong>Advanced Snapshot Export</strong> is available from the <strong>File</strong>-&gt;<strong>Export</strong> menu in the <strong>3D Main Window</strong>
Invoking the command will display the following dialog:</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/export/SnapshotAdvancedExport.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This table defines which 3D Views to modify, and how to modify them. Each row defines the modifications of a specific view, and for all the combinations a row specifies, a snapshot is generated.</p>
<p>To edit a row, the row must be activated by toggling it on in the <strong>Active</strong> column, then double click on the cell to edit.</p>
<p>Options represented by columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>View</strong> &ndash; Selects the view to modify.</li>
<li><strong>Result Type</strong>, <strong>Properties</strong> &ndash; Defines a list of eclipse result properties to cycle through when creating snapshots. If properties from both the dynamic and static list is needed, you must create a new row.</li>
<li><strong>Start Time</strong>, <strong>End Time</strong> &ndash; Defines the time step range to cycle through when creating snapshots.</li>
<li><strong>Range Filter Slice</strong>, <strong>Range Start</strong>, <strong>Range End</strong> &ndash; Defines a range filter slice that will be added to the view, and then cycled from <em>Range Start</em> to <em>Range End</em> when creating snapshots.</li>
<li><strong>Cases</strong> &ndash; Defines the cases to cycle while creating snapshots. Normally you can not change which case a view is displaying, but this option does temporarily.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of exported snapshots from a row can easily end up being huge, so it is wise to use some caution. The total number will be Properties * Time Steps * Range Steps * Cases.</p>
<p>Rows can be deleted and created by right-clicking in the table. 5 rows are created for convenience by default.</p>
<p>The snapshots will be generated and saved to the folder displayed in the <strong>Export Folder</strong> field, when pressing the <strong>Export</strong> button. This might take quite some time, depending on you settings.</p>

Summary Plots are a display of curves based on Eclipse Summary Data which can be combined with imported observed data, grid cell time history curve, and pasted ascii curves.
Summary plots are displayed on screen by maximum four rows by four columns of plots. In the example above, ResInsight displays two columns and two rows of plots, each plot comprising a single curve. However, a plot may contain an arbitrary number of curves. As shown in the screenshot above, essential helpers for setup of Summary Plots are:
Plots: overview of established plots and their components Property Editor: settings for titles, legends, layout, axes, and appearance Data Sources: searching and sourcing data from case, field, regions, wells, groups, or ensemble Templates: overview, management and use of templates for summary plotting Plot Manager: powerful text-based selection of vectors for summary plotting Essential actions are presented as controls in the toolbar to increase productivity and ease of use.
Creating Summary Plots Using Data Sources to create Summary Plots Having imported Eclipse Summary Data, Data Sources provides an easy approach to create Summary Plots:
Search or navigate Data Sources to find the desired source(s) and vector(s) Right-click selected vector(s) and select New Summary Plot Drag &amp; Drop additional vector(s) to append curves into an existing plot or vacant plot area Creating a new summary plot of WBHP of Well B-1H and subsequent Drag &amp; Drop of WGOR and WGORH into the same subplot produces the following. ResInsight will automatically make new axes if necessary. If units are the same as for WGOR and WGORH, a new axis is unnecessary.
Using Plot Manager to create Summary Plots Having imported Eclipse Summary Data, the Plot Manager provides an alternative and powerful approach to create Summary Plots by text-based selection of data sources and vectors to plot.
Summary Plots and Functionality Multiple Summary Plots and Curves The Data Sources window enables efficient creation of multiple plots and curves by Right-clicking:
Use Append Curves to append curves for the selected vectors into all existing plots. Use Append Plots for Wells to create separate plots for the selected vectors. If a plot contains curves pertinent to a single data source, you may easily append corresponding plots for other entries of the type by right-clicking or drag and drop. In the examples above, the curves are pertinent to the single data source well B-1H. Thus you may easily append corresponding plots for other wells by right-clicking as shown below.
Alternatively, you may simply and efficiently drag and drop the selected wells into the plot area. In fact, you may drag the entire folder into plot area to append plots for all wells.
Subsequently, you may:
Adjust the number of columns and rows and preview the pages of plots using the toolbar Use keyboard PgUp/PgDown or scroll wheel to browse and validate the pages of plots Snapshot the curves or export to PDF-file via the toolbar-buttons or Edit menu The data source of displayed curves is rapidly changed by Summary Plot Source Stepping.
Visual comparison of multiple summary curves ResInsight may ease comparison of multiple summary curves by selecting a plot in Plots and using the settings in Property Editor group Axes.
The different options are:
Y Axis Range: Defines the data source for Y Axis range to either individual, all subplots, all wells, all regions, or all realizations. Link Y Axes: When checked, the axes of all subplots will be treated to obtain plots with identical axes. Link Time Axis: When checked, the time axes of all subplots will identical. Auto Plot Settings: When checked, ResInsight creates axes with titles, ranges, tickmarks, and units for best possible appearance. Plot Mouse Interaction Value Tracking: When the mouse cursor is close to a curve, the closest curve sample is highlighted and the curve sample value is displayed in a tooltip. Selection: Left mouse button click can be used to select several items of the plot and display them in the Property Editor: The closest curve Each plot axis The summary plot itself if none of the above is hit and the Plots window is activated by the mouse click Window Zoom: Available by dragging the mouse with left mouse button pressed across plot area of interest. Wheel Zoom: The mouse wheel will zoom the plot in and out towards the current mouse cursor position presupposing use of mouse wheel is not disabled by toolbar button . You may simply double click a subplot to restore its default zoom level. Use toolbar button or View menu option Zoom All to restore default zoom level for the entire plot.
For scrolling multiple pages of plots by using the mouse wheel, disable Wheel Zoom by the toolbar button .
Highlighting a curve or axis A summary curve is highlighted when left-clicked in a plot. This eases detailed investigation of a specific curve in plots comprising many curves.
Another essential feature is to left-click an axis in a summary plot which will highlight the curves corresponding to the particular axis. As exemplified below, clicking the axis Gas Production Total highlights the WGPT curve and dims the other curves.
Summary curves can also be activated and deactivated by clicking the check-boxes in Plots window. See also Plots right-click menu items, e.g. On - Others Off which is an effective way to deactivate all curves not selected.
Duplicate plot, Copy and Paste An entire summary plot may be duplicated using the toolbar button Duplicate Plot.
Copy and Paste of a summary plot, subplot (see below) or curve is also possible using the Plots right-click menu and standard keyboard shortcuts (CTRL-C/CTRL-V). This enables pasting a subplot or curve to wherever desired in the the Plots tree.
Filtering of subplots Filtering of subplots allows the user to disable/hide subplots containing data below a user defined threshold. To activate filtering of subplots, click a plot in Plots window, set the Y-axis Threshold in Property Editor, and click Apply Filter.
Splitting a plot into subplots A plot with many curves can easily be split into multiple subplots. Right-click a composite plot in Plots and select Split Into Single Curve Plots to split into subplots each comprising one curve.
Accessing Plot Data Right-clicking a plot in Plots window and selecting Show Plot Data will open a window containing the plot data as text columns. The window displays plot data by day, week, month, quarter, half year and year.
Resampling Method Description
For aggregated values (*OPT and similar), the resampled value is calculated based on linear resampling.
For rate values (*OPR), the total volume in the requested resample interval is computed. The rate value is then computed by
$Rate_{period} = \\frac{TotalVolumePeriod}{period}$
The text content of this window is easy to copy and paste into Excel or other tools for further processing. It is also possible to save the text data to a file by the right-click command Export to File.
Editing Summary Plots A color selection dialog can be opened by clicking on the color icon in the Project Tree. The settings of each plot are listed in the Plots window for overview and are controlled by its sub-items and the Property Editor. Editing a Summary Curve By selecting a specific summary curve in the Plots window, its properties are displayed by the Property Editor.
The Property Editor organizes the available options into the following groups:
Summary Vector &ndash; Options to select case, vector to plot, resampling, axis specification, and error bars. Stacking - Options to control stacking of curves optionally with phase colors. Appearance &ndash; Options to control curve color, symbols, line style etc. Curve Name &ndash; Controls how the curve is labeled in the legend. Advanced &ndash; Specification of additional options. Other actions are available via right-click menu for selected curve. For instance, the Y-Axis for one or more curves can be switched for using the right-click command Switch Plot Axis.
Default Time Axis Properties Time axis properties are displayed by clicking the Time Axis subitem of a summary plot in Plots window.
Custom Time Axis Properties The time labels are automatically defined based on the available date range. The tick marks can be controlled in details by setting Tickmark Type to Custom. Then a tickmark interval and tickmark interval step can be defined.
In the screenshot above, the interval is set to three years, and the plot displays labesl with three years between each.
Y-axis Properties Y-axis properties are displayed by clicking one of the left/right axis subitems of a summary plot in Plots window.
The property groups are:
Title Text: Caters for automatic or user specification of title and inclusion of vector name, acronym, and units in plot. Title Layout: Positioning of title (Center or At End) and font size. Axis Values: Logarithmic scale, inversion of axis, legend number formatting, scale factor, max/max range, and font size. Changing content of a Summary Plot Right-clicking an existing summary plot in Plots and selecting Edit Summary Plot initiates the Summary Plot Editor which offers complete functionality to navigate and select vectors from all summary types.

Saturation Pressure Plots ResInsight can create plots displaying bubble and dew point pressures, together with initial pressure in model, versus depth. Fluid contacts (GOC and/or OWC) are displayed as annotation lines in the generated plots.
See Saturation Pressure Plots
Sector Model Export Sub-sections of the Eclipse Grid with Parameters and Faults can be exported to Eclipse ASCII files in order to create new Simulations on the sub-section. These sub-sections can also be refined to a higher resolution.
See Export Sector Model
Well model for ICD, AICD and ICV ResInsight supports interactive modeling of ICD, AICD and ICV. It is possible to export completions to a text file containing the Eclipse input data keywords needed to represent the completions as a Multi Segment Well - MSW.
See Completions and Completion Export
Grid Model Annotations Annotation objects like text, lines and plolylines can easily be added to a view.

Version 2019.12 is a major update bringing a range of significant new and enhanced features. Some of the most important extensions are listed below.
Comparison View ResInsight offers a Comparison View to compare two existing views in terms of grid geometry, results, intersections and more. The Comparison View allows comparison of information of different grids and different solutions on the same grid in a single view. This improves efficiency and simplifies the workflow when working with related but different models.
Support for Summary Plot Templates ResInsight 2019.12 includes numerous enhancements to Summary Plots and notably support for Summary Plot Templates which are defined by a number of curves with preset appearance and vector names. Having tailored a plot setup, the user can save the setup as a template definition to file for later reuse.
Ensemble RFT data import and plotting ResInsight allows the user to create a ensemble RFT plot similar to summary ensemble plots. The functionality includes advanced color schemes for differentiation of curves, computation of statistics, and import of observed ensemble RFT data from FMU.
Command line interface for Summary plotting ResInsight scripting has been extended with summary plotting commands that plot summary vectors based on textual specifications including the use of wildcards for selection and filtering. For more information and examples of use, see Command line interface for Summary Plotting.
Text-Based Curve Creation and Source Stepping Text-Based Curve Creation allows specification of a list of vectors for plotting based on selected sources. The history of text-based curve specifications are recorded to allow for effective use.
This is possible to combine with Summary Source Stepping which has been extended to further support swift stepping through multiple vectors.
Export Contour plot data ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D Plane. Any 3D result value can be aggregated, in addition to specialised results, such as oil, gas and hydrocarbon columns. A Contour Map is a specialised 2D view with many of the same features as the 3D views, including property filters, range filters and display of faults and wells. For more information, see Contour Map Export.
Well Bore Stability plots Major extensions and enhancements have been added to Well Bore Stability plots for Geomechanical cases. Well Bore Stability plots are specialized Well Log Plots to visualize Formations, Well Path Attributes as well as a set of well path derived curves in different tracks.

Multilateral Wells ResInsight lets the user create Multilateral Well Paths by clicking in the 3D view. Completions can be added to laterals, and the complete specification of the well can be exported using the Completion Export
Streamlines Streamlines lets the user investigate the flow of different phases through a reservoar. It allows for selecting both an individual phase or a combination of phases colored by the dominant phase or velocity. The visualization and animation of streamlines requires the Eclipse properties FLRGASI/J/K FLRWATI/J/K FLROILI/J/K.
Objective Functions Objective Functions are used to color the curves of an ensemble plot in ResInsight to highlight characteristics by a function definition based on individual summary vectors. As shown in the example above, the legend relates colours to values as calculated by a particular objective function and shows the use and formula of the objective function in the plot.
Vertical Flow Performance Plots A Vertical Flow Performance Plot (VFP Plot) shows the relationship between bottom hole well conditions and wellhead pressure describing a well&rsquo;s ability to lift fluids to the surface. ResInsight can display both production and injection VFP plots.

Breaking changes for user defined well paths The calculation of the geometry for a user defined well path had some defects. These issues are now fixed, and can affect the generated geometry of a user-defined well path. If the ResInsight project file was stored with a version before 2023.01, loading the project in version 2023.01 and later can potentially generate a slightly different well path geometry from the target at sea level to the first user-defined well target (the location of user-defined well targets are unchanged). The location of perforation intervals and completions are specified by measured depth, and could be shifted to a different location.
Thanks to https://github.com/EdmundStephens for reporting this issue.

Data Sources provides an overview of all data sources for summary plots by category to provide search, selection, and essential functionality pertinent to summary cases.
As seen above, Data Sources enables search and sourcing of data from case, field, regions, wells, groups, or ensemble. See Summary Plots which illustrates use of Data Sources for effective search and selection of data for summary plots.
Searching for data sources Atop the Data Sources window, there is a search field for effective searches across all available data sources. As exemplified below, typing just a few letters initiates a search for vectors prefixed by wbh across all data groups listing all hits.
Summary Cases functionality Right-clicking the Summary Cases entry in Data Sources displays the functionality pertinent to summary cases.
Delta Summary Case and Delta Ensemble A Delta Summary Case or Delta Ensemble can be created as either the sum or difference between two existing summary cases or ensembles, respectively.
To create a delta summary case, for instance, right click and select New Delta Summary Case. The Property Editor for the new delta case allows to modify display name, the two base summary cases, and the arithmetic operator. In addition, it is possible to specify a specific time step to be used in delta computation. As exemplified below, the delta computation between two cases for a given parameter, e.g. WBHP, will be: $$WBHP_{delta}(t) = WBHP_{case1}(@02.01.2000) - WBHP_{case2}(t)$$ An existing delta summary case may be input to a new delta summary case.
Curve calculator The Curve Calculator is a tool to perform vector calculations on a set of curves. The created curves can be stored for later use.
Summary Case functionality Right-clicking a specific Summary Case in Data Sources displays the functionality pertinent to a single summary case.
The highlighted menu item, right-clicking a summary case in Data Sources and select Replace will redisplay all configured plots with data from another case.
Please also note the menu options to create summary plot from Template which is a powerful and effective way to create summary plots with a specific appearance and content. When invoking a well-specific template on Summary Case level as shown above, the convention is that ResInsight selects the first well listed under as data source.

Log ASCII Standard (LAS) is a standard file format common in the oil-and-gas industry to store well log information.
Importing a LAS file Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files can be imported using the command: File-&gt;Import-&gt; Well Data-&gt;Import Well Logs from File.
ResInsight will look for the the well name in the imported LAS-files among the existing Well Paths. If a match is found, the LAS-file is placed as a child of that well path. If not, a new empty well path entry is created with the imported LAS-file under it. A well path may have more than one LAS-files as children.
If the LAS-file does not contain a well name, the file name is used instead.
Moving a LAS file If ResInsight&rsquo;s automatic well matching fails and a LAS-file is matched with the wrong well path, it is possible to move the LAS-file to the correct well path. Select the LAS-file right-click menu click Move LAS File to Well Path and select destination well path.
Look for an Existing Well Path Well names may vary slightly among different files from the same well. When importing a well log file, ResInsight have to look for an existing well path item to ensure that the well log data and well path are imported to the correct well path item. The lookup is based on name comparison this way:
First remove any prefix (like xxxxx1111/1111- or xxxxx1111/1111_) Then try an exact name match If not found, try to match the names ignoring all spaces, dashes and underscores If still no match, no existing well was found and a new one is created Supported Date Formats During LAS import, ResInsight parses a date on file according to the following expressions. Supported separators between day, month, and year are space, underscore, hyphen, and dot.
Expression Description d day as number without a leading zero (1 to 31), e.g. 7 dd day as a two digit number (01 to 31), e.g. 07 M month as number without a leading zero (1-12), e.g. 8 MM month as a two digit number (01-12), e.g. 08 MMM short month name in uppercase or lowercase (&lsquo;Jan&rsquo; to &lsquo;Dec&rsquo;), e.g. AUG yy year as a two digit number (00-99), e.g. 19 yyyy year as a four digit number, e.g. 2019 Examples of supported date expressions are listed in the following table.

The main results to post process in ResInsight are Cell Results. A Cell Result is one value, or a small set of values per cell over a region of the grid. A Cell Result is also referred to as a Property.
Cell Results are used in several operations and settings:
Cell Colors Cell Edge Result (Eclipse Only) Separate Fault Result (Eclipse Only) Property Filters Well Log Extraction Curves Cell Result Time History Curves In the property panel of all those, the same options are used to define the Cell Result of interest.
In the following we will describe these options.
Eclipse Result Types Results and difference options are displayed by the Property Editor.
The different result types are:
Dynamic &ndash; Time varying properties of an Eclipse simulation and derived properties calculated by ResInsight, c.f. Derived Results Static &ndash; Eclipse properties that does not vary with time and derived properties calculated by ResInsight, c.f. Derived Results SourSimRL &ndash; Available if SourSimRL results have been imported, c.f. SourSimRL Import Generated &ndash; Results generated by an Octave Script Input Property &ndash; Directly imported Eclipse properties from ascii files Formation Names &ndash; Lists only the Active Formation Names selected on the case, c.f. Formations Flow Diagnostics &ndash; Flow diagnostic results derived from a flux field, c.f. below Injection Flooding &ndash; Calculation of derived property based on one or more selected simulation tracers, c.f. below Difference options are:
Difference Case &ndash; Base case for calculation of difference Base Time Step &ndash; Base time step for calculation of difference For some cell face results, it is possible to normalize the results by cell face area.
The difference option is not applicable for TERNARY result display.
Flow Diagnostic Results ResInsight has embedded Flow Diagnostics calculations made available using the Flow Diagnostics result type. These results make it easier to see how and where wells interact with the reservoir and each other. It is possible to select exactly what wells to investigate, and even the possible opposite flow part of the well.
See also Flow Diagnostics Plots and Flow Characteristics Plot
Method The calculations are performed by a library called opm-flowdiagnostics developed by SINTEF Digital.
This method is based on the presence of a flux field, and will use the flux field written to the Eclipse result data file (Cell Properties: FLRGAS, FLRWAT, FLROIL) if available. If these are not available, the flux field is estimated by algorithms in the opm-flowdiagnostics-applications library based on pressure differences, relative and absolute permeability and viscosity. Other effects are not included.
A more elaborate description of the technique and how it can be utilized, can be found at Sintef&rsquo;s web site. The MRST tool described is a Matlab predecessor of the flow diagnostics calculations developed for ResInsight.
The methodology is also described in: The application of flow diagnostics for reservoir management SPE J., Vol. 20, No. 2, pp. 306-323, 2015. DOI: 10.2118/171557-PA
Cross Flow and Opposite Flow The opposite flow of a well denotes the flow that is opposite to the expected normal state of the well. E.g. parts of a producer might actually be injecting due to cross flow, and an injector could be producing in some sections. Each well is assigned an opposite flow name by adding &ldquo;-XF&rdquo; to the end of the name. &ldquo;-XF&rdquo; was chosen as a reference to Cross Flow.
In this way, a producer will have two tracer names: The &ldquo;well name&rdquo; as a producer tracer, and &ldquo;well name-XF&rdquo; as an injector tracer.
Defining Results There are several options available to define the particular result you want to target, as shown below:
There are two main selections you need to make: The tracers and the result property
Tracers &ndash; Option to select how/what tracers to use. Available options are: All Injectors and Producers &ndash; Selects all the wells, including the opposite flow tracers All Producers &ndash; Selects all producer tracers, including the opposite flow tracers of injectors. All Injectors &ndash; Selects all injector tracers, including the opposite flow tracers of producers. By Selection &ndash; Displays lists of all the injector tracers and producer tracers side-by-side allowing any to be selected freely. Both lists of selectable tracers can be filtered by typing in parts of the name. The tracers will have a suffix of [I/P] if they are both injector and producer, thus appearing in both lists. All producers communicating with the selected injectors (and vice-versa) can be selected with the &ldquo;Add Communicator&rdquo; buttons. Phases &ndash; Select the fluid phase you are interested in: All, Oil, Gas or Water. If one of the separate phases are selected, only the Time Of Flight result property will be available in the list below. Result property &ndash; Displays a list of the available results: Residence Time &ndash; The time for some fluid in the cell to reach a producer, or the time it takes to reach the cell from an injector. The option changes name depending on the selection of injectors and producers and will be Forward Time of Flight if only injectors are selected and Reverse Time of Flight if only producers are selected. When selecting several tracers, the time of flight values from each of the tracers are weighted by their cell fraction before they are averaged. The suffix (Average) will then be added to the option label. Tracer Cell Fraction (Sum) &ndash; The volume fraction of a cell occupied by the selected tracers. The injector and producer tracers counts as independent in this regard, so the sum of fractions for all the producer tracers will be 1.0 and the same for the injector tracers. If both types of tracers are selected, the total sum will normally reach 2.0. Drainage/Flooding Regions &ndash; Shows which of the selected tracers that has the largest fraction in each cell. This is shown as a category result displaying a color for each tracer, and the names in the legend. If only injectors are selected, this option will be labelled Drainage Regions and if only producers are selected, it is called Flooding Regions. Injector Producer Communication &ndash; The communication in a cell between a set of producers and a set of injectors is calculated as the sum of producer fractions multiplied by the sum of injector fractions in the cell. This produces values between 0.0 and 1.0 where high values indicate that both the injectors and the producers have a high influence. On-Demand Calculation The flow diagnostics results are only calculated when asked for, and only for requested time steps. This means that statistics based on all time steps are not available for these results.
Injection Flooding This result type is used to plot derived results based on a selection of simulated tracers, typically seawater injection. Currently the only derived property available is Water Flooded PV. Please refer to Derived Results for more information.
Tracers &ndash; Lists the available simulation tracers from the Eclipse Case. The list is produced by showing only the properties with names ending with the letter &ldquo;F&rdquo;. Select the tracers you want to investigate. Result Property &ndash; Select the variable you want to calculate. (Number Of Flooded PV is currently the only one) Geomechanical Results Geomechanical results are sorted in different Result Positions:
Nodal &ndash; Results given a value per node in the grid Element Nodal &ndash; Results with values per element node Integration Point &ndash; Results with values per integration point. These are displayed in the same way as element nodal results. Element Nodal on Face &ndash; Results with values transformed to element faces or intersections. See Element Nodal on Face for more information Formation Names &ndash; Lists the Active Formation Names selected on the case. ( See Formations ) Element &ndash; Imported element property table results. One value pr element. See Element Property Table Import Several derived cell properties are calculated. Please refer to Derived Results for more information.
Relative Result Options This group of options controls time-lapse results to be calculated. ( See Relative Results for more information )
Select Color Result In the 3D view, the result property for a selected cell can be found by right-clicking on the 3D view and choosing Select Color Result. The corresponding result property will be shown in the Property Editor.

Repeat parameter for multiple replace operations. --replaceSourceCases [&lt;caseGroupId&gt;] &lt;gridListFile&gt; Replace source cases in &lt;caseGroupId&gt; or first grid case group with the grid files listed in the &lt;gridListFile&gt; file. Repeat parameter for multiple replace operations. --commandFileReplaceCases [&lt;caseId&gt;] &lt;caseListFile&gt; Supply list of cases to replace in project, performing command file for each case. Project to replace cases must be set with commandFileProject. If caseId is not supplied, first case is replaced. When supplying caseId, multiple cases may be replaced at once, by supplying several caseIds and a file containing a list of grid-files to replace with for each caseId. Reduce project load time using &ndash;replaceSourceCases ResInsight stores data computed by statistics calculation in a cache file. When a project file is loaded, data from this cache is also imported. For large cases, the cached data can be large. When replacing source cases during batch, this data is never used and can be removed from the cache using the following workaround: Open the project file used to produce statistics Select the statistics object in the project tree Click the button Edit (Will DELETE current result) Save the project file Summary plotting The summary plotting command option follows the following syntax:
resinsight --summaryplot [&lt;plotOptions&gt;] &lt;eclipsesummaryvectorfilters&gt; &lt;eclipsedatafiles&gt; where: &lt;plotOptions&gt; denote summary plot options, see table below &lt;eclipsesummaryvectorfilters&gt; has the syntax &lt;vectorname&gt;[:&lt;item&gt;[:&lt;subitem&gt;[:i,j,k]]] &lt;eclipsedatafiles&gt; lists a set of Eclipse data files with or without extension The summary plotting command option creates one summary plot for each of the the summary vectors matched by
&lt;eclipsesummaryvectorfilters&gt; using all listed Eclipse data files in each plot.
Eclipse summary vector filters specify a list of vectors separated by spaces following the syntax noted above. Wildcards can be used in the specification. Brief examples are:
WOPT:*: One total oil production curve for each well. FOPT FWPT: Two curves with oil and water total production. BPR:15,28,*: Oil phase pressure for all blocks along k as separate curves. Please note no space in expression. Examples are listed below.
As long as only summary vectors are requested, only the corresponding SMSPEC file will be opened for each case. However, if a grid property is requested, the corresponding EGRID and restart data will be loaded as well.
Specifying summary plot options is optional, c.f. table below.
Option Description -help Shows help text and ignores any other option. -h Includes history vectors read from summary file if the vectors exist. Only history vectors from the first summary case in the project will be included. -nl Omits legend in plot. -s Creates only one plot including all the defined vectors and cases. -n Scales all curves into the range 0.0-1.0. Useful when using -s. -e Imports all the cases as an ensemble, and create ensemble curves sets instead of single curves. -c &lt;parametername&gt; Same as -e, but colors the curves by the ensemble parameter . -cl &lt;parametername&gt; Same as -c, but uses logarithmic legend. Testing Parameter Description --regressiontest &lt;folder&gt; System command --updateregressiontestbase &lt;folder&gt; System command --unittest Execute integration tests --ignoreArgs System command See also the Regression Test System for a more in-depth explanation.
Examples Most examples are also available from the test section.
Create snapshots of all views for multiple cases A list of cases is defined in CaseList.txt, containing the following
Real0/BRUGGE_0000.EGRID Real10/BRUGGE_0010.EGRID Real30/BRUGGE_0030.EGRID Real40/BRUGGE_0040.EGRID The command line used to run this example is shown here:
ResInsight --project BatchTest.rsp --multiCaseSnapshots CaseList.txt --size 500 500 This will instruct ResInsight to read the project file BatchTest.rsp. All cases will be replaced one by one in ResInsight, and snapshots of all views will be written to file.
Replace a single case and take snapshots of all views The command line used to run this example is shown here:
ResInsight --project BatchTest.rsp --replaceCase &#34;Real10\\BRUGGE_0010.EGRID&#34; --savesnapshots This will instruct ResInsight to read the project file BatchTest.rsp. The specified case Real10\\BRUGGE_0010.EGRID will be imported into the project, and snapshots of all views will be written to file.
Replace source cases in a case group and create snapshot A list of cases is defined in CaseList2.txt, containing the following
Real0/BRUGGE_0000.EGRID Real10/BRUGGE_0010.EGRID The command line used to run this example is shown here:
ResInsight --project BatchStatistics.rsp --replaceSourceCases CaseList2.txt --savesnapshots This will instruct ResInsight to read the project file BatchStatistics.rsp. All cases specified will be imported in the case group specified in the project file. Statistics will be computed, and snapshots for all views will be written to file.
Replace source cases in multiple case groups and create snapshots Multiple source case groups can be updated by repeating the replaceSourceCases parameter.
The command line used to run this example is shown here:
ResInsight --project BatchStatistics.rsp --replaceSourceCases 0 CaseList2.txt --replaceSourceCases 1 CaseList3.txt --savesnapshots This will instruct ResInsight to read the project file BatchStatistics.rsp. Source cases for case group 0 is given in CaseList2.txt, and source cases for case group 1 is given in CaseList3.txt. Statistics will be computed, and snapshots for all views will be written to file.
The possibility to replace multiple cases can also be applied for single case replace (parameter replaceCase).
Summary plotting The following command line performs a summary plot for FOPT based on Eclipse summary file 1_R001_REEK-0.SMSPEC.
ResInsight --summaryplot FOPT 1_R001_REEK-0 Based on file 1_R001_REEK-0.SMSPEC, the following command line performs a summary plot for FOPT and any WOPT-vector for well op_2. The trailing option -s gathers the vectors into a single summary plot.
ResInsight --summaryplot -s FOPT WOPT*:op_2 1_R001_REEK-0 Adding to previous example, the following command line also plots the 3D grid property SOIL for cell (20, 21, 1).
ResInsight --summaryplot FOPT WOPT*:op_2 SOIL:20,21,1 1_R001_REEK-0 `,html:`<p>ResInsight supports several command line parameters that can be used to automate some tasks using shell scripts.</p>

The summary curve calculator is a tool to do calculations on a set of curves. The created curves can be stored for later use in the project.
The calculator can be run by pressing the calculator icon in the menu bar, or by right-clicking on either a summary case or the summary plot collection.
Expressions can be saved to a text file using the Export Calculations button. The default location for calculations can be set in Preference-&gt;Import/Export.
More details on mathematical operations are described in Calculator Expressions
Calculation Settings To make a new calculated curve, click on New Calculation. This will add a new calculation to Calculated Summaries. Before choosing which curves to do calculations on, a calculation expression must be made. The default expression Calculation_1 := x + y will do a vector addition on the curves which x and y are placeholders for, and assign it to the calculation Calculation_1.
To assign a summary address to a variable, select a summary vector in Data Sources, and drag/drop this vector into the address field in the Curve Calculator. Further details on variable assignment is covered in section Summary Address Selection.
By default, a calculation defined for one well will be distributed to all other wells. This feature can be disabled by unticking Distribute to other items
Unit It is possible to add a unit to the calculated curve, in the field Unit beneath the expression field. This will be used as the label on the y-axis when the curve is displayed in plots.
Summary Address Selection An expression consists of placeholders (variables) for curves (summary address). By clicking Parse Expression, the variables will appear in the table below the settings. To assign a summary address to a variable, select a summary vector in Data Sources, and drag/drop this vector into the address field in the Curve Calculator.
It is also possible to select the address by pressing the Edit button. This action will open a Summary Address Selection dialog. Use the dialog to select a summary address and press OK.
Generating Curves After assigning summary addresses to all variables, click Calculate to evaluate the expression. The curve is saved and can be accessed in the Plot Editor.
Calculation for Ensembles All calculation expressions are available for ensemble plotting. Use the calculation objects the same way as they are used for single summary cases.

This is only possible if you or your organization has a copy of the ODB-Api from Simulia, and a valid license to use it.
If you have, and would like to a use these features, please see Build Instructions for a description on how to build ResInsight and how to include the support for odb-files.
Geo Mechanical Data Support Geo-mechanical data can be imported using the Import -&gt; Geo Mechanical Cases menu. Here three options are present: Import Geo Mechanical Model, Import Geo Mechanical Model (Time Step Filtered) (both for odb files) and Import Element Property Table.
ResInsight supports the elements C3D8R, C3D8 and C3D8P which are all HEX8 cells. It is also assumed that there are no other element topologies present in the odb file, and that there are only one part. For IJK-based range filters to work, it is also assumed that the elements in the part is topologically arranged as a complete box.
ResInsight loads the second frame within each odb-step, and present those as the time series for each result.
All the result fields in the odb-file is then available for post processing in ResInsight, but stresses and strains are converted to pressure-positive tensors as normally used in geomechanics, instead of the normal tension-positive tensors that ABAQUS stores.
Pressure and stress are always displayed using the Bar unit.
Other derived results are also calculated, and are described in Derived Results ResInsight Features Most of the central features of ResInsight visualization setup also applies to ABAQUS Odb models, like range filters and property filters. Well Paths will also show up along with the odb models.
The Octave interface, however, does not support the odb-data yet.
Time Step Filtered Import By choosing the Import Geo Mechanical Model (Time Step Filtered) option, it is possible to limit the amount of time steps that are imported to improve the speed and reduce the memory use. If this option is chosen a tile step filter dialog is shown after selecting the file to import.
The data can be filtered by skipping Days, Weeks, Months or Years in the top Filter Type drop down list and the range of time steps can be picked in the First Time Step and Last Time Steps lists. Furthermore, the final selection can be fine tuned by selecting or deselecting individual time steps in the Select From N Time Steps list. ResInsight will ignore any data that doesn&rsquo;t match these time steps and will thus reduce the amount of data imported.

ResInsight offers a built-in property calculator for grid parameters. The Grid Property Calculator enables arithmetic expressions to be parsed and calculated for visualization purposes. The expression can be applied to one or multiple grid models, and the expression text can be stored to a file for later use.
Expressions can be saved to a text file using the Export Calculations button. The default location for calculations can be set in Preference-&gt;Import/Export.
More details on mathematical operations are described in Calculator Expressions
Invoking the Grid Property Calculator Invoke the the Grid Property Calculator by pressing the calculator icon in the menu bar or by right-clicking Cell Result in Project Tree.
Example using Grid Property Calculator As shown, the Grid Property Calculator is invoked by right-clicking Cell Result in Project Tree. As seen below, the Grid Property Calculator is per default prefilled with the simple summation Calculation_1 := x + y. This simple summation suffices for exemplifying its use. However, you may change name of the calculation and add additional variables and arithmetic operators in the Expression field.
If statements are also supported with the following syntax NEW_TRANX := if((TRANX &lt; 0.01), 0.01, TRANX)
The next step is to define the variables x and y. An easy way to define each variable is to drag and drop properties from Data Sources. See screenshot below for drag and drop of SOIL from Data Sources to the row of variable x in Grid Property Calculator (emphasized in red). Continue with drag and drop of SGAS to define y.
Finally, press Calculate to perform the actual calculation.
The calculated result is accessable via Property Editor as Type Generated Result Property.

ResInsight can require a considerable amount of memory to hold all the grids and necessary result variables. If the requirements starts approaching the available physical memory on the workstation, ResInsight may become unstable and crash, as the operating system starts freeing memory to avoid system failure. To help alleviate this, ResInsight has some built-in memory management tools.
Memory Indicator The tools are available from the memory indicator in the bottom right corner of the main 3D window.
If the available physical memory dips below 5% of the total physical memory on Windows, a warning will be displayed in the memory indicator. This threshold is 17.5% on Linux, as the memory manager on Linux is more likely to start stopping processes when memory is low. The amount of memory used will also be displayed in progress bars during operations in ResInsight if the available memory is less than 50% of total physical memory. In any case, ResInsight is likely to be stopped without warning by the operating system if the amount of used memory starts approaching the total physical memory on the computer.
Memory Management Tool It is possible to click on the memory used indicator to open up a dialog allowing the user to clear results from memory when they are no longer required. Any tool that is not currently used in a view may be cleared by selecting the result and clicking the Clear Checked Data From Memory. Note that, depending on your operating system, this may not result in a reduction in the memory reserved by the application. However, the actual use will have gone down and it may now be possible to run more operations without running out of memory.
Detailed usage of memory can be seen by clicking Show Memory Report. By default, results will be shown for the active case. However, a specific case may be selected in the top drop down list. The pictures below show the dialog for both Eclipse and Abaqus results.

ResInsight can import well paths from simple Ascii files. In addition, ResInsight is able to retrieve well paths from an Equinor internal web service.
ResInsight also supports creation of your own user-defined well paths. See Create Well Paths
Ascii Well Paths The command File -&gt; Import -&gt; Well Data -&gt; Import Well Paths From File will read the well paths in the selected file, and create one entry for each well path under the Wells item in the Project Tree.
The supported ASCII format is quite flexible but the main requirements are:
Each data line must contain four numbers: X Y TVD(MSL) MD(RKB) separated with white-space. Lines starting with &quot;--&quot; or &quot;#&quot; is considered to be comment lines A line starting with none-number-characters are used as a well name after the following rules: If the line contains a pair of : &quot;'&quot;, &quot;\`&quot;, &quot;´&quot;, &quot;’&quot; or &quot;‘&quot; the text between the quotation marks is used as a well name. If the line contains the case insensitive string &ldquo;name&rdquo; with an optional &ldquo;:&rdquo; after then the rest of the line is used as a well name. If there are no quotes or &ldquo;name&rdquo;&rsquo;s, the complete line is used as a well name. If there are several consecutive name-like lines, only the last one will be used If a well name is found, a new well is created and the following data points are added to it. Example 1: WELLNAME: WELL1 6507.1	725	2542	2590 6523.5	757	2549	2626.6 6523.5	760	2559	2637.1 -999 WELLNAME: WELL2 550.7 1020.2 2410 2410 551 1004.1 2422.2 2430.2 555.2 993.9 2425 2441.6 -999 Example 2: X Y TVD(MSL) MD(RKB) Name Well_1 6507.1	725	2542	2542 6523.5	757	2549	2578.6 6523.5	760	2559	2589.1 -- A Comment new well This is not its name Name Well_2 550.7	1020.2	2410	2520 551	1004.1	2422.2	2540.2 # a comment inside the data 555.2	993.9	2425	2551.6 3Q AHB-J 5507.0	4638.5	0.0	0.0 5507	4638.5	1628.6	1628.6 Well Path Files are Referenced The well path data is not copied into the ResInsight project as such. The project file only stores the file path, and the next time you open the project, ResInsight will try to read the well data from the file again.
If the well path file is changed and you would like a running ResInsight to update accordingly, you will need to delete all the well paths that emerge from that file, and import it again.
Importing well paths from SSI-Hub SSI-Hub is an Equinor internal webservice. In order to import well paths from SSI-Hub, a project file must be present and stored to file. All imported well paths from the web service will be stored relative to this project file location. If no project file exists, the menu item is disabled.
The command File -&gt; Import -&gt; Well Data -&gt; Import Well Paths From SSI-hub launches a wizard to guide you through the process of selecting the well paths you need. Having completed the wizard, the imported wells are accessible as Items under the Wells item in the Project Tree.
The well path data is not copied into the ResInsight project as such, but is stored in files in a directory called ProjectFileName_wellpaths in the same directory as your project file.
Access to web service: If you are an Equinor employee, make sure you have access to &ldquo;EDM Landmark&rdquo; and &ldquo;EDM Compass&rdquo;.
Well Path Visualization All the imported well paths are available below the Wells item in the Project Tree.
The visible wells are always shown in all the 3D Views in the complete project, so the toggles and settings control the overall project visibility of the Well Paths. The Property Editor of the Wells item is shown below
Global well path visibility &ndash; This option forces the well paths on or off, ignoring the individual settings unless it is set to Individual. Clip Well Paths &ndash; This option hides the top of the Well Paths to avoid displaying the very long lines from the reservoir to the sea surface. Well Path clipping depth distance &ndash; This number is the distance from the top of the reservoir to the clipping depth. Individual Well Path A well path will hold well log data and well path data imported from files. A well path file is placed inside the well path item, while one or more well log files are placed as child items under the well path in the project tree.
Importing Well Log Files Well log data is imported from LAS-files.
Well Path Property Editor The well path property editor lets the user control the appearance of the well path and associate the well path to a simulation well. It also gives some information about the well path metadata.
Appearance group &ndash; Settings in this group affect the well path appearance in the 3D view File group &ndash; Information about the well path file Simulation Well group &ndash; Associated simulation well. ResInsight will try to associate each well path with a simulation well. This is done in the exact same way as looking up an existing well path. If the auto-association fails, the user can set the correct simulation well here. Well Info group &ndash; Metadata for the well path Well Picks group &ndash; Information about imported well picks file containing data for the current well path Casing Design Some Casing Design elements can be assigned to the well path by selecting Create Casign Design from the right-click menu of the well path.
This will create a new child object for the Well Path, named Casing Design. In the Casign Design Property editor well path containment properties such as Casing (with Casing Shoe) and Liner can be added to the well path along with a start and end depth and a diameter.
These can be visualised in the 3D View and Well Log Plots on a Well Log Track.

<p>ResInsight can import well paths from simple Ascii files.
In addition, ResInsight is able to retrieve well paths from an Equinor internal web service.</p>
<p>ResInsight also supports creation of your own user-defined well paths. See <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/wells-and-completions/createnewwellpaths/">Create Well Paths</a></p>
<h2 id="ascii-well-paths">Ascii Well Paths</h2>
<p>The command <strong>File -&gt; Import -&gt; Well Data -&gt; Import Well Paths From File</strong> will read the well paths in the selected file, and create one entry for each well path under the <img src="https://opm.github.io/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/WellCollection.png" style="display:inline; vertical-align:middle; margin:0">

<p>The supported ASCII format is quite flexible but the main requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each data line must contain four numbers: X Y TVD(MSL) MD(RKB) separated with white-space.</li>
<li>Lines starting with <code>&quot;--&quot; or &quot;#&quot;</code> is considered to be comment lines</li>
<li>A line starting with none-number-characters are used as a well name after the following rules:
<ul>
<li>If the line contains a pair of : <code> &quot;'&quot;, &quot;\`&quot;, &quot;´&quot;, &quot;’&quot; or &quot;‘&quot;</code> the text between the quotation marks is used as a well name.</li>
<li>If the line contains the case insensitive string &ldquo;name&rdquo; with an optional &ldquo;:&rdquo; after then the rest of the line is used as a well name.</li>
<li>If there are no quotes or &ldquo;name&rdquo;&rsquo;s, the complete line is used as a well name.</li>
<li>If there are several consecutive name-like lines, only the last one will be used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a well name is found, a new well is created and the following data points are added to it.</li>

Octave Octave is now detected searching the file system. If Octave is not detected, the following file path variable must be defined:
OCTAVE_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE : d:\\octave\\Octave-4.0.0\\bin\\octave-config.exe
It is possible to build ResInsight without compiling the Octave plugins. This can be done by specifying blank for the Octave CMake options. The Octave plugin module will not be built, and CMake will show warnings like &lsquo;Failed to find mkoctfile&rsquo;. This will not break the build or compilation of ResInsight.
ResInsight has been verified to build and run with Octave versions 3.4.3, 3.8.1, and 4.0.0 on RedHat linux, and 4.0.0 on Windows.
Octave Dependencies for Debian Based Distributions The following command line can be used as a starting point to install required libraries sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential octave liboctave-dev qtbase5-dev qtscript5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtbase5-private-dev
ODB support ResInsight can be built with support for ABAQUS ODB files. This requires an installation of the ABAQUS ODB API from Simulia on the build computer. The path to the ABAQUS ODB API folder containing header files and library files must be specified. Leaving this option blank gives a build without ODB support. ResInsight has been built and tested with ABAQUS ODB API version 6.14-3 on Windows 7/8/10 and RedHat Linux 6.
HDF5 HDF5 is used to read SourSimRL result files. On Windows this is optional, while on Linux the installed HDF5 library will be used if present.
Use an advanced flag RESINSIGHT_HDF5_BUNDLE_LIBRARIES to include HDF5 libraries in the installation package.
Tested with 1.8.18 on windows, and default installation on RedHat 6.

<p>The command file is comprised of a set of commands to be executed in order. Each command must begin on a separate line, i.e. there cannot be two commands on the same line.</p>
<p>The line starts with the command name, followed by parenthesis. Within the parenthesis, parameters can be supplied. Each parameter must be named, followed by an equals sign and its value.</p>
<p>As an example; <code>openProject(path=&quot;/path/to/ResInsightProject.rsp&quot;)</code> will execute the command <code>openProject</code> with the parameter <code>path</code>. <code>path</code> is a string, see <a href="#types">Types</a> for a list of all types a parameter can have.</p>
<p>Not all parameters are required, in which case they can be omitted and their value will be defaulted. The order of parameters does not matter.</p>

ResInsight lets the user create new/custom well paths by clicking in the 3D view. A self created well path will behave the same way as an imported well path.
Building a multilateral well path
Building a well path Right click Wells in the project tree Select Create Well Path in the right-click menu. A new well node and a well targets node are created Click in the 3D view on locations where the well path should pass (well path targets) When finished placing targets, click on &ldquo;Stop Picking Targets&rdquo; in the property editor Well targets property editor fields:
UTM Reference Point - Reference point. Defaults to the first target point clicked. Link Reference Point - All wells with this option checked will be moved as a group. Air Gap - Specify Air Gap, i.e. distance from Rotary Kelling Bushing to sea surface. Applies to well path export only. MD at First Target - Defines the measured depth at the first defined well target. Generate Target at Sea Level - Automatically create a target at sea level based on a reasonable well path from reservoir to sea level Well Targets Appearance
Controls the visibility and appearance of spheres at well target locations in addition to 3D interaction handles. The 3D interaction handles will be visible only when the Well Target object is selected, but the spheres will be always be visible if enabled.
Well Targets
List of all defined well targets. The editor will have a contrast background color when in picking state.
Relative Coord - Target position relative to reference point. UTM Coords can be displayed using a checkbox option above the table. MD - Measured depth along the well path. DL in - Dog leg inwards [degrees/30m]. DL out - Dog leg outwards [degrees/30m]. Azi (deg) - Azimuth. Y axis is 0 degrees. If the Azi checkbox is ticked, the user can provide a fixed value for Azimuth. Inc (deg) - Inclination. Z axis is 0 degrees. If the Inc checkbox is ticked, the user can provide a fixed value for Inclination. The other columns defined by the &ldquo;Est&rdquo;-prefix displays the result of dog leg and direction values produced by the well path geometry estimation algorithm.
A well path defined by well targets may be edited by either editing coordinates in the property editor or clicking and dragging targets in the 3D view.
Well Target Interaction Operations When the well target handles are active in the 3D view, the following operations are possible when pressing left mouse button on well target handles:
Clicking and dragging the blue part of a target, it can be moved along the Z axis only. Clicking and dragging the magenta part of a target, it can be moved horizontally in the XY-plane.
User Interaction Description Mouse Move Modification of a single target Mouse Move + CTRL Modification of all well target on selected well (laterals excluded) Mouse Move + CTRL + SHIFT Modification of all well targets (laterals included) Well Path Duplication To duplicate an existing well path, select Duplicate from the right-click menu of a well path in the Project Tree or right-click on the well path geometry in the 3D view. This operation will create a new well path with a set of well targets.
The full geometry of the new well path is an estimate of the source well path, so the geometry might differ slightly.
Starting well path at a fixed position The toggle Generate Target at Sea Level is on by default. If the well path is supposed to start at a predefined location at the sea level, the following procedure can be used:
Right click Wells in the project tree Select Create Well Path in the right-click menu. A new well node and a well targets node are created. Clear Generate Target at Sea Level Right-click in the pink well target area, and select Insert new Target above In the UTM Reference Point field, enter the predefined UTM coordinate (usually, the depth is set to 0.0 for sea level) Continue clicking on geometry in the 3D view to add more well targets and make sure the first well target is defined by [0.00 0.00 0.00] to make sure the first target is located at the predefined UTM reference position Well Plan A well plan can be displayed by selecting Show Well Plan from the right-click menu of a generated well path.

`,url:"/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/getting-started/modelnavigation/"},window.store["/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/import/observeddata/"]={title:"Observed Time History Data",content:`Observed Time History Data, is data measured in time. On import of observed time history data, ResInsight translates the data to make it similar to summary data. Observed time history data can be plotted along with summary data in Summary Plots.
Import Observed Time History Data Importing observed time history data to ResInsight may be performed in two different ways:
By selecting the main menu item File -&gt; Import -&gt; Import Observed Data By using the right-click command Import Observed Data on the Observed Data item in the Plot Main Window Project Tree The following file types are supported:
RSM observed time history data file (*.rsm) Column based (Comma Separated Values, CSV) time history data file (*.csv/*.txt) The imported Observed Data files will be added to Observed Data. Which summaries that has been detected in a Observed Data file can be read in an Observed Data&rsquo;s Property Editor. In the image below, time and year info has been found together with the summary &ldquo;WBP9L&rdquo; for the well &ldquo;OP-1&rdquo;.
File Formats Import CSV/txt Observed Time History Data CSV/txt files are generic ascii files where data is arranged in columns. Some variations in formatting is supported, for instance deifferent cell separators, date and time format, decimal separator etc. When importing these types of files the user is presented a dialog, where the user may tell ResInsight how to import the selected file(s). If more than one file is selected, the dialog appears once for each file.
CSV/txt Import Options Dialog Dialog fields description:
Cell Separator &ndash; Select the correct cell separator character. ResInsight will try to set the correct value as default. Decimal Separator &ndash; Select the correct decimal separator. ResInsight will try to set the correct value as default. Selected Time Column &ndash; Select the column that contains the time/date information. The first column is default. Use Custom Date Time Format &ndash; Check this box if the Date Format and/or Time Format in the file do not match any of the most common formats. Custom Date Time Format &ndash; Enter date time format to match the time information in the file. This field is visible only when the above check box checked. A tooltip will tell the user how to enter the correct information. Date Format &ndash; Select the date format matching the date information in the file. Time Format &ndash; Select the time format matching the time information in the file. If the file contains dates only, this field is ignored by ResInsight. Preview &ndash; Preview the first 30 lines of the file contents. The view will reflect the currently selected Cell Separator and the selected time column is marked in yellow. Column data Each column must have a header text, which may be a name/description for the data in the column. By formatting the header text to a valid Eclipse address, ResInsight recognizes the column data and will be able to categorize the data in the same way as grid data. So when plotting these data later, the user will find the data in the correct category in the Summary Plot Editor.
Eclipse address format An Eclipse address consists of a vector name and zero or more parameters. The number of parameters are defined by the category of the vector. The category is determined by looking up the category in an internal vector table. A valid standard vector name has 3 to 5 characters. Optionally it may be postfixed by a user defined name of 3 characters. A vector name having both a standard part and a user part must have 8 characters (5+3). In this case, if the standard part has less than 5 characters, it must be padded with underscores up to 5 characters. Example: &lsquo;RPR__WEL&rsquo;. Vector names having only the standard part are not padded.
Categories:
Field - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;F&hellip;.'&gt; Example: &lsquo;FOPT&rsquo; Aquifer - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;A&hellip;.&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;AQUIFER NUMBER&gt; Example: &lsquo;AAQR:1&rsquo; Network - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;N&hellip;.'&gt; Misc - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;&hellip;.'&gt; Region - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;R&hellip;.&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;REGION NUMBER&gt; Example: &lsquo;RPR:1&rsquo; Region to Region - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;R.F..&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;REGION NUMBER&gt;-&lt;REGION NUMBER&gt; Example: &lsquo;ROFR:1-2&rsquo; Group - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;G&hellip;.&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;GROUP NAME&gt; Example: &lsquo;GOPR:MANI-B1&rsquo; Well - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;W&hellip;.&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;WELL NAME&gt; Example: &lsquo;WOPR:B-2H&rsquo; Completion - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;C&hellip;.&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;WELL NAME&gt;:&lt;I&gt;,&lt;J&gt;,&lt;K&gt; Example: &lsquo;COFRL:C-1H:26,44,16&rsquo; LGR Completion - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;LC&hellip;&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;LGR NAME&gt;:&lt;WELL NAME&gt;:&lt;I&gt;,&lt;J&gt;,&lt;K&gt; Example: &lsquo;LCWIT:WELLI1:I1:5,5,5&rsquo; LGR Well - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;LW&hellip;&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;LGR NAME&gt;:&lt;WELL NAME&gt; Example: &lsquo;LWWIR:WELLI1:I1&rsquo; Segment - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;S&hellip;.&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;WELL NAME&gt;:&lt;SEGMENT NUMBER&gt; Example: &lsquo;SOFR:B-5H:32&rsquo; Block - &lt;Vector &lsquo;B&hellip;.&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;I&gt;,&lt;J&gt;,&lt;K&gt; Example: &lsquo;BPR:15,18,21&rsquo; LGR Block - &lt;VECTOR &lsquo;LB&hellip;&rsquo;&gt;:&lt;LGR NAME&gt;:&lt;I&gt;,&lt;J&gt;,&lt;K&gt; Example: &lsquo;LBOSAT:CENTER:5,5,5&rsquo; Imported - &lt;SOME NAME&gt; When ResInsight parses an eclipse address, it first tries to identify an address category by analyzing the vector name, as described above. If no category could be found, the Imported category is used. This category is also used if the address format is wrong (for instance missing parameters) even though the vector name identifies a different category.
Instantaneous vs Accumulated Data
A valid Eclipse vector having a standard name ending with &lsquo;T&rsquo; or &lsquo;TH&rsquo; are considered accumulated data. In the summary plot, these types of data are plotted slightly different. Instantaneous data are plotted using a stepped curve, while accumulated data are plotted using straight lines between the samples.
Error data
Any address may have associated error data. Those type of data will have the same address as their associated data, but are prefixed by &lsquo;ER:&rsquo;, &lsquo;ERR:&rsquo; or &lsquo;ERROR:&rsquo;. Example: &lsquo;ERR:FOPT&rsquo;. It is not possible to select error data explicitly in the plot editor selection fields, but when selecting a vector having associated error data, the error data is plotted as error bars in the summary plot.
Example:
CSV Line Based Format ResInsight supports a &rsquo;line based&rsquo; CSV file format variant as well. As opposed to the normal CSV format, data values are organized in lines. Each line must contain at least a date (and time), a vector address and a sample value. Optionally it may also contain an error value and a comment. The information carried by this format is equivalent to the normal CSV format, it is only a different file layout.
When importing a line based CSV file, no dialog appears. Instead a more stict set of rules apply to this type of files:
At least DATE, VECTOR and VALUE columns must be present. The order of columns may be changed. Optionally the columns ERROR and COMMENTS may be present ISO date format must be used: &lsquo;yyyy-mm-dd&rsquo; or &lsquo;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm&rsquo; Semicolon (;) must be used as column separator Point (.) must be used as decimal separator The comment must not contain any semicolons Example The two examples below are equvalent and result in identical data after importing to ResInsight
Line based CSV:
DATE ;VECTOR ;VALUE ;ERROR 2018-04-16 ;FOPT ;12.5 ;0.45 2018-04-18 ;FOPT ;8.6 ;0.31 Normal CSV:
DATE ;FOPT ;ERR:FOPT 2018-04-16 ;12.5 ;0.45 2018-04-18 ;8.6 ;0.31 Import RSM observed time history data To import RSM files, the only action needed from the user is to select one or more RSM files. When the import is finished, one tree node for each file will appear under the Observed Data node in the project tree. RSM files can be either Column based or Keyword based.
Column Based File Format If a column based file is presented, ResInsight first tries to identify if its header has fixed width or not. Further, the header is interpreted by looking for specific lines.
The first line must have one or more vector mnemonics. The initial letter(s) in a mnemonic specify which summary data type the column represents. For instance, FVPT and FWPT are of type Field, as they both have an initial F. WWCTH and WGORH are well data types. See Vector naming convention in Eclipse: File Formats Reference Manual for a full overview of supported mnemonics.
The next lines can define units, well/group names, region names, LGR names and block numbers and the local cell number. They do not have to appear in any particular order. Scale factors can also be included, but will be ignored by ResInsight. All lines starting with &ndash; will also be ignored.
Column Based with Fixed Header Width When interpreting column based files with fixed header width, ResInsight looks for left aligned column entries. These type of files are interpreted as we naturally read them. More than one table can be present in each file.
1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY ------------------------------------------------------------------------- DATE FGIRH FVPT FWPT FOPT FLPT SM3/DAY RM3 SM3 SM3 SM3 *10**3 *10**3 *10**3 *10**3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6-NOV-1997 0 0 0 0 0 7-NOV-1997 0 5.749954 0.004548 4.379801 4.384350 8-NOV-1997 0 13.76883 0.010841 10.48852 10.49936 9-NOV-1997 0 19.38692 0.015243 14.76847 14.78372 10-NOV-1997 0 24.07161 0.018914 18.33751 18.35642 11-NOV-1997 0 28.79427 0.022613 21.93558 21.95819 Column Based with Random Header Width Column Based with Random Header Width will try to be parsed in the same way as fixed width, but it might fail in situations like the one below. We can see that SM3/SM3 probably belongs to WGORH, but it is parsed to WWCTH, as it is the second entry on that line.
TIME WWCTH WGORH DAYS SM3/SM3 A-5HP A-5HP 1 0.000 0.000 2 0.000 0.000 3 0.000 0.000 Keyword Based File Format If the non-comment line includes the word &ldquo;VECTOR&rdquo;, the file is interpreted as a keyword based file. In keyword based files, the content of the one-column tables is described in each header. Tables should be associated with a table containing time stamps. In the example below, S-1AH-GOR is associated with YEARX, since their origin is equal. ResInsight always interpret ORIGIN as well name, and look for a table with the line &ldquo;VECTOR YEARX&rdquo; to associate with it.

<p>When ResInsight parses an eclipse address, it first tries to identify an address category by analyzing the vector name, as described above. If no category could be found, the <strong>Imported</strong> category is used. This category is also used if the address format is wrong (for instance missing parameters) even though the vector name identifies a different category.</p>
<p><strong>Instantaneous vs Accumulated Data</strong><br>
A valid Eclipse vector having a standard name ending with &lsquo;T&rsquo; or &lsquo;TH&rsquo; are considered accumulated data. In the summary plot, these types of data are plotted slightly different. Instantaneous data are plotted using a stepped curve, while accumulated data are plotted using straight lines between the samples.</p>
<p><strong>Error data</strong><br>
Any address may have associated error data. Those type of data will have the same address as their associated data, but are prefixed by &lsquo;ER:&rsquo;, &lsquo;ERR:&rsquo; or &lsquo;ERROR:&rsquo;. Example: &lsquo;ERR:FOPT&rsquo;. It is not possible to select error data explicitly in the plot editor selection fields, but when selecting a vector having associated error data, the error data is plotted as error bars in the summary plot.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/import/ErrorBars.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="csv-line-based-format">CSV Line Based Format</h3>
<p>ResInsight supports a &rsquo;line based&rsquo; CSV file format variant as well. As opposed to the normal CSV format, data values are organized in lines. Each line must contain at least a date (and time), a vector address and a sample value. Optionally it may also contain an error value and a comment. The information carried by this format is equivalent to the normal CSV format, it is only a different file layout.</p>
<p>When importing a line based CSV file, no dialog appears. Instead a more stict set of rules apply to this type of files:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least <strong>DATE</strong>, <strong>VECTOR</strong> and <strong>VALUE</strong> columns must be present. The order of columns may be changed.</li>
<li>Optionally the columns <strong>ERROR</strong> and <strong>COMMENTS</strong> may be present</li>
<li>ISO date format must be used: &lsquo;yyyy-mm-dd&rsquo; or &lsquo;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm&rsquo;</li>
<li>Semicolon (;) must be used as column separator</li>
<li>Point (.) must be used as decimal separator</li>
<li>The comment must not contain any semicolons</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>The two examples below are equvalent and result in identical data after importing to ResInsight</p>
<p>Line based CSV:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span style="display:flex;"><span>DATE       ;VECTOR ;VALUE ;ERROR

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="import-rsm-observed-time-history-data">Import RSM observed time history data</h3>
<p>To import RSM files, the only action needed from the user is to select one or more RSM files. When the import is finished, one tree node for each file will appear under the <strong>Observed Data</strong> node in the project tree. RSM files can be either <em>Column based</em> or <em>Keyword based</em>.</p>
<h4 id="column-based-file-format">Column Based File Format</h4>
<p>If a column based file is presented, ResInsight first tries to identify if its header has fixed width or not. Further, the header is interpreted by looking for specific lines.</p>
<p>The first line must have one or more vector mnemonics. The initial letter(s) in a mnemonic specify which summary data type the column represents. For instance, <em>FVPT</em> and <em>FWPT</em> are of type <em>Field</em>, as they both have an initial <em>F</em>. <em>WWCTH</em> and <em>WGORH</em> are well data types. See <em>Vector naming convention</em> in <strong>Eclipse: File Formats Reference Manual</strong> for a full overview of supported mnemonics.</p>
<p>The next lines can define units, well/group names, region names, LGR names and block numbers and the local cell number. They do not have to appear in any particular order. Scale factors can also be included, but will be ignored by ResInsight. All lines starting with <em><em>&ndash;</em></em> will also be ignored.</p>
<h5 id="column-based-with-fixed-header-width">Column Based with Fixed Header Width</h5>
<p>When interpreting column based files with fixed header width, ResInsight looks for left aligned column entries. These type of files are interpreted as we naturally read them. More than one table can be present in each file.</p>

<p>Column Based with Random Header Width will try to be parsed in the same way as fixed width, but it might fail in situations like the one below. We can see that SM3/SM3 <em>probably</em> belongs to WGORH, but it is parsed to WWCTH, as it is the second entry on that line.</p>

<p>If the non-comment line includes the word &ldquo;VECTOR&rdquo;, the file is interpreted as a keyword based file. In keyword based files, the content of the one-column tables is described in each header. Tables should be associated with a table containing time stamps. In the example below, <em>S-1AH-GOR</em> is associated with <em>YEARX</em>, since their origin is equal. ResInsight always interpret <em>ORIGIN</em> as well name, and look for a table with the line &ldquo;VECTOR YEARX&rdquo; to associate with it.</p>

The plot editor is a separate ResInsight dialog window where the user can select which vectors to display in a summary plot. It is also possible to edit an existing plot in this editor.
The upper part of the editor contains editors for selecting which vectors/summaries to display in the plot. The number of fields vary from 3 to 6 depending on the Summary Type currently highlighted.
Here highlighted means marked item with different background color, while selected means item(s) having a ticked check box.
Selection Fields This section describes the different selection fields in the selection part of the plot editor. A complete/valid vector selection consists of a selected source, a selected summary category, a selected item in each dynamic field (if any) and a selected vector among the Summaries.
Sources This field contains all imported cases and ensembles. Select the case(s) and/or ensemble(s) to display in the plot.
Summary Types and Item Selection Fields In the mid-section of the dialog, the Summary Type and the corresponding Items can be selected.
Field &ndash; Select Field related vectors only Aquifer &ndash; Select Aquifer category vectors only Network &ndash; Select Network category vectors only Misc &ndash; Select vectors in the Misc category only Region &ndash; Select Region related vectors only Region-Region &ndash; Select Region to Region related vectors only Group - Select Group related vectors only Well &ndash; Select Well related vectors only Completion &ndash; Select Completion related vectors only Lgr-Completion &ndash; Select Completion in LGR related vectors only Lgr-Well &ndash; Select Well in LGR related vectors only Segment &ndash; Select Segment related vectors only Block &ndash; Select I, J, K &ndash; Block related vectors only Lgr-Block &ndash; Select I, J, K - Block in LGR related vectors only Calculated &ndash; Select calculated vectors created by the curve calculator. Imported &ndash; Select observed data vectors imported from file (e.g. CSV, RSM files) Summaries This field contains the summaries/vectors for the highlighted summary category.
Preview Plot When a complete/valid vector exists, one or more curves will appear in the preview plot. Each curve will also have a corresponding item in the curves field in the lower left corner. Visibility for the curves may be controlled by the checkboxes. Each curve is automatically assigned a name and appearance. However the user may modify these settings in the Curve Name Configuration and Curve Appearance Assignment fields.
Plot and Curve Name Configuration The checkboxes in this field control which information elements to include in the curve name. Toggling some of the checkboxes will have no effect on some curves depending on which information elements are relevant for each curve.
Curve Appearance Assignment Curves created are assigned individual visual properties like colors and symbols in a systematic manner to make the plots easy to read. Different aspects of the vectors are assigned to different curve appearances. E.g. using symbols to distinguish cases, while using colors to distinguish quantity.
These assignments can be controlled using the options in the Curve Appearance Assignment group.
When set to Auto, ResInsight assigns visual properties based on the present vector categories and the number of different values in each category.
When disabling the Auto option, you can select which of the visual curve properties to use for which summary category. The summary category that currently can be used is Case, Vector, Well, Group and Region. The visual properties supported types are Color, Symbols, Line Style, Gradient and Line Thickness.
The Apply button must be clicked to apply the new settings to all curves.
The curve appearance settings apply to single summary curves only and do not affect ensemble curve sets. Curve sets receive their appearance automatically from a set of color ranges.
Assignment of curve appearance are incremental, and can end up as sub optimal if adding curves in several steps. Press the Apply button to apply consistent appearance settings according to the current curve selection.
Curves The curves field displays all summary curves and ensemble curve sets matching the settings in the selection fields. Those are separated in two groups, Summary Curves and Ensemble Curve Sets. The check box at each item controls which items are displayed in the preview plot.
If the user make a selection that will result in a huge number of ensemble curves, ResInsight will display a drawing performance warning, and the newly created curve set(s) are toggled off by default.
Target Plot In the bottom of the dialog window Target Plot may be specified. The target plot is the summary plot that will receive the selected curves when the OK or Apply button is clicked.
By default the target plot is set to (new plot) or to the plot selected for editing when invoking the command.
Setting the target plot to a different plot will add the selected curves to that plot when pressing the the OK or Apply button.

ResInsight offers both a rich set of built-in color legends and functionality for import and customizing color legends. All color legends are available from the Color Legends item in Project Tree.
Standard Color Legends ResInsight offers an extensive set of built-in color legends as listed by Standard Color Legends. As Standard Color Legends cannot be modified, you must create a Custom Color Legend when needing a legend that is not covered by Standard Color Legends.
Create a Custom Color Legend Custom Color Legends are created by right-clicking the Color Legends item in Project Tree to either import a Formation file with color settings or create a new Custom Color Legend.
It is also possible to copy a standard legend to create a Custom Color Legend as basis for customization.
When importing a Formation Names description files (*.lyr) with colors, ResInsight automatically creates a color legend and use this as default color legend when visualizing formations in the 3D view.
Customizing a Color Legend A newly created Custom Color Legend is initially empty as basis for inclusion of Color Legend Items by right-clicking its entry.
As seen below, the right-click menu also allows for deletion of a Color Legend Item. The property editor is used to define each Color Legend Item.
The sequence of Color Legend Items can be modified by clicking the arrow symbols seen below.
The listed Custom Color Legend is used to form the 3D visualization of formations seen by the top figure of this page. Activating this particular Custom Color Legend is performed by specifying it as Result Color Legend.
Integer Cell Results When displaying interger cell results, the default color mapping will be set to a category color mapping. This color legend is used when displaying Formation Names. If an integer result is loaded, a custom color legend with names can be used.

Here settings are grouped into three categories: Data Selection, Appearance and Name Generation.
Data Selection The Curve Data configuration allows you to select a case, result type, property and time step to plot.
Parameter Description Case The eclipse or geomechanical case to retrieve the data from Result Type Dynamic, static, generated, input property, formation names, flow diagnostics or injection flooding Result Property The parameter to plot Time Step Which time step to show Appearance In the Curve Appearance box, the curve can be assigned to a draw plane, the color can be changed and a range of curve values applied. The range of the result property can be set with the minimum and maximum curve value settings. The curve range is by default set to the minimum and maximum values found in the data set and these values are retained in the label if different values have been chosen.
The draw plane can be vertical (above well path, centered and below well path) and horizontal (left, centered and right). If multiple curves are added and assigned to the same draw plane, they will appear in the same curve plot.
Name Generation Finally the name of the curve is created automatically from a set of parameters such as case, view, etc. The parameters that should make up the curve name can be selected in the Curve Name box. Only extraction log curves have multiple settings here. The automatic name generation will be automatically switched off if the curve has been renamed manually and can be switched back on by checking the Generate Name Automatically tick box.

Exclude Main Bore Transmissibility &ndash; If this options is checked on, only the transmissibilities for the fishbone laterals will be included in the export, and transmissibility along the main bore will not contribute. Transmissibility Calculations The transmissibility calculation is performed for each direction, X, Y and Z, in an orthogonal coordinate system local to the cell.
Taking the X direction as an example, we first calculate the relevant permeability K from the Eclipse properties PERMY (Ky) and PERMZ (Kz):
The Peacman radius (pressure equivalent radius) for the cell is then calculated, using permeabilities and cell sizes (Dy and Dz):
The x-component of the transmissibility vector is calculated, using the length of the perforation in the x direction (lx), the well radius (rw) and skin factor (S):
The y and z component of the transmissibility are calculated in the same manner, and the total transmissibility is then calculated as:
If the Export Calculated Transmissibilities is chosen in the export setting (see Exporting Completion Data to Eclipse), this value is exported in the COMPDAT/COMPDATL keywords directly. If the Export Default Connection Factors and WPIMULT the transmissibility is chosen, the transmissibility is calculated as above, and in addition the transmissibility is calculated as Eclipse would do it using values other than transmissibility in the COMPDAT/COMPDATL keywords (perforation length, well radius etc). The ratio between these transmissibilities is then exported as the WPIMULT value.
For an example of COMPDAT files exported with calculated transmissibilities and with defaults and WPIMULT values, see export of fishbones completion data below.
Fracture Export Pressure Differential Depletion Scaling For cases with high differential depletion, it is possible to scale the transmissibilities from the grid cells into the well (via the fracture) by the well drawdown. This enables the simulation to take into account that the flow will take different paths into the well as the pressure differential between the surrounding grid cells increases. If enabled, a time step for the grid pressures have to be selected. The list of time steps will also show the time step in which the wells first show a Well Bore Hole Pressure (WBHP) larger than zero in the Summary Case information.
Having chosen a time step for differential depletion scaling a source for the well pressures can be chosen. If WBHP From Summary Case is picked, the WBHP value in the summary case for the chosen time step is used. However, if the chosen time step precedes the production start of a well, the value set in WBHP Before Production Start is used.
If, however, a Fixed User Defined WBHP is chosen, the provided WBHP value is used for all wells.
Fracture Report Header At the top of the exported transmissibilities for fractures, a fracture report summary is displayed. This section displays the different properties for the fractures used to compute the transmissibility values.

This table will show the well name, fracture name and the source of the Well Bore Hole Pressure (WBHP From Summary Case or Fixed User Defined WBHP). For WBHP From Summary Case the User WBHP column will describe the well pressure used for all time steps before the production starts according to the summary case information and the Actual WBHP will describe the well pressure used in the scaling, which will be different from the User WBHP if the scaling is performed for a time step following the well productions start. Finally the columns Min Pressure Drop and Max Pressure Drop describes the minimum and maximum well drawdown for this particular fracture.

PresDrop - specifies what is included in the pressure drop calculation, hydrostatic, friction or acceleration. Specified by user in the Fishbones property editor. The following WELSEGS entries contains information about each segment:
First Seg, Last Seg &ndash; Values are being exported pr segment, so both first and last segment number is the number of the segment being exported. Branch Num &ndash; Branch number for segment being exported. Outlet Seg &ndash; The segment the exported segment is connected to. For the main bore segments, this is the segment before them, for ICDs the segment number being exported and for fishbone laterals the segment on the main broe where the laterals are connected. Length &ndash; Length of segment (if incremental Len&amp;Dep above) or length of segments including this along well (if absolute Len&amp;Dep above). For ICDs length is set to 0.1. Depth Change &ndash; Depth of segment, incremental or absolute as for Length. For ICDs depth is set to 0. Diam &ndash; Diameter of segment. For main bore and ICD entries, the liner inner diameter for the Fishbones collection is used. For laterals, an effective diameter is calculated so that the diameter exported is the diameter which, assuming a circle, would give the same area as the area between the hole diameter and the tubing diameter.

<h4 id="pressure-differential-depletion-scaling">Pressure Differential Depletion Scaling</h4>
<p>For cases with high differential depletion, it is possible to scale the transmissibilities from the grid cells into the well (via the fracture) by the well drawdown. This enables the simulation to take into account that the flow will take different paths into the well as the pressure differential between the surrounding grid cells increases. If enabled, a time step for the grid pressures have to be selected. The list of time steps will also show the time step in which the wells first show a <strong>Well Bore Hole Pressure</strong> (<strong>WBHP</strong>) larger than zero in the Summary Case information.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/export/Completions_Export_PDD_TimeStep.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Having chosen a time step for differential depletion scaling a source for the well pressures can be chosen. If <strong>WBHP From Summary Case</strong> is picked, the <strong>WBHP</strong> value in the summary case for the chosen time step is used. However, if the chosen time step precedes the production start of a well, the value set in <strong>WBHP Before Production Start</strong> is used.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/export/Completions_Export_PDD_WBHP.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If, however, a <strong>Fixed User Defined WBHP</strong> is chosen, the provided <strong>WBHP</strong> value is used for all wells.</p>

<p>The transmissibility calculation for the fishbones is done following the above description except that when calculating the transmissibility for the laterals, the full cell volume is split among the laterals for calculation of the transmissibility. This is done by finding the direction of the main bore, and then dividing the cell size in this direction by the number of laterals in the cell when calculating the Peaceman radius.</p>

ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D Plane. Any 3D result value can be aggregated, in addition to specialised results, such as Oil, Gas and Hydrocarbon columns. A Contour Map is a specialised 2D view with many of the same features as the 3D views, including property filters, range filters and display of faults and wells. ResInsight is able to export a contour map to a text file.
Creating New Contour Maps Contour Maps can be created in many different ways:
New Contour Map from the right-click menu of case or the Contour Maps project tree item underneath the case. These will create contour maps with default values. New Contour Map from 3D View in the Eclipse View right-click menu. This will create a contour map based on the existing 3D View with matching filters and result. Duplicate Contour Map from the right-click menu of an existing Contour Map. This will copy the existing map. Properties of the Contour Maps A contour Map has many of the same options available as a 3D View, but is always orthographic/parallel projection with no perspective projection or lighting available. Instead of the 3D Grid Box, the Contour Maps uses a 2D Grid simular to the 2d Intersection Views with optional Axis Lines controlled with the Show Axis Lines toggle. The name of the map can be automatically generated from the Case Name, Property Type, Aggregation Type and Sample Spacing (See Map Projection Properties for the two latter).
Map Projection Properties The Map Projection settings control how the 3D Data is aggregated onto the 2D plane. In all cases the results are calculated for a square 2D Cell lying in an arbitrary z-plane of the 3D Grid. For each 2D cell a cuboid extrusion in the full bounding extent of the 3D grid is created and this cuboid extrusion is used to calculate the volume of intersection with the 3D Grid cells for all volume weighted sums and averages. For the regular sums, a vertical ray through the center of the 2D cell is used instead. Since the ray may travel through multiple cells in the same K-layer, all the values from within one K-layer are averaged before being added to the sum.
A set of parameters governs this projection:
The first option Sample Spacing Factor controls how many 2D Grid Cells are used in the map. The factor is multiplied by the characteristic cell length/width of the 3D grid to get the 2D Cell Size. A smaller factor will thus create a finer Contour Map. The second option Show Contour Lines toggles on/off the contour lines in the view. The final control in the Projection Settings box is the Result Aggregation. Here the following options are available: Aggregation Type Description Oil Column A sum of SOIL * NTG * PORO * dZ Gas Column A sum of SGAS * NTG * PORO * dZ Hydrocarbon Column A sum of (SOIL + SGAS)* NTG * PORO * dZ Arithmetic Mean A volume weighted arithmetic mean of the specified cell result Harmonic Mean A volume weighted harmonic mean of the specified cell result Geometric Mean A volume weighted geometric mean of the specified cell result Volume Weighted Sum A volume weighted sum of the specified cell result. Suitable for volume fractions such as SOIL or PORO Sum A sum of the specified cell result. Suitable for absolute quantities. Top Value The first value encountered downwards vertically Min Value The minimum cell result value in the volume underneath the 2D Element Max Value The maximum cell result value in the volume underneath the 2D Element For the Column options, no Cell Result is available in the property tree under the Contour Map.
Weighting Means by Cell Result For the Arithmetic Mean, Geometric Mean and Harmonic Mean it is also possible to specify a cell result as a weighting parameter in addition to the regular weighting by volume of intersection. The total weight will then be the volume of intersection multiplied by the specified cell result. The full range of regular cell results is available for this use.
Difference options Creating a Contour Map as a difference with a specific base case and/or base time step is performed by clicking the Cell Result item underneath the actual Contour Map in the project tree. This will display the Cell Result [Property Editor] (/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/3d-main-window/cellresults/#eclipse-result-types) to specify base case and/or base time step.

A Summary Cross Plot is a window displaying a graph in the main area of the Plot Main Window. It is very similar to an ordinary Summary Plot, but the x-axis displays summary vector values instead of time. Regression analysis is supported on single cross plot curves and ensemble statistics curves.
Summary Cross Plot Curves New cross plot curves are created by using the right-click command New Summary Cross Plot Curve on a summary plot.
Cross plot curves can also be created from the right-click menu in the Summary Data Sources. The combination of cross plot curves are defined in Plotting Preferences. Select the cross plot curve object to modify the properties for the curve. Make sure that the Axis Type is set to Summary Vector.
In this property editor, there is an additional group called Summary Vector X Axis. Like the other property editor groups, the vector selection groups works the same way as in the ordinary summary plot.
See the detailed description.
Summary Cross Plot Ensemble When computing statistics curves for the ensemble, the x-axis is divided into bins. For each bin, all values are collected. A minimum realization count is used descide if there are enough realizations to compute statistics. The number of bins and realization count threshold can be set in the Property Editor for the ensemble.
When creating cross plots based on ensembles, the appearance of curves can be adjusted in the property editor. Note that the appearance of statistics curves also can be customized in the Statistics group. Regression analysis is supported on ensemble statistics curves.
Cross Plotting A cross plot is established based on two input summary vectors. Each entry in the cross plot consists of one vector item value from each of the two input vectors having equal time steps. However, in most cases the two input vectors do not share the same time steps. To be able to create a cross plot in such cases, linear interpolation between adjacent input vector items is being used.
When a current time step T in input vector A is not found in input vector B, ResInsight interpolates between the time steps before and after T in vector B. In this way, ResInsight calculates an interpolated value for time step T from vector B. The same happens when a time step in vector B is not found in vector A.
If either the value at the current time step or one of the values involved in interpolation are NULL, the resulting vector will have a NULL value at the current time step. This is displayed as a &lsquo;hole&rsquo; in the cross plot curve.

Template creation A summary plot template is defined by a number of subplots and curves with preset appearance and vector names. Having tailored a plot setup, the user can save the setup as a template for later reuse via the Plots window right-click command Save As Plot Template which pops the Export Plot Template dialog seen above.
A Summary Plot Template can subsequently be used for summary plotting of various data sources. The data sources that can be selected and varied by the user are:
case(s), ensemble(s), and realization(s) well(s), group(s), and region(s) When saving a Summary Plot Template, ResInsight incorporates by default placeholders for using the template in conjunction with various wells, groups, and regions. On the other hand, expand and check the appropriate boxes if you want to persist the specific wells, groups, and/or regions as part of the plot template definition. To exemplify, checking Wells for persistence enables plotting of data for the exact wells of the template in conjunction with any ensemble realization.
Upon export, ResInsight automatically categorizes the template as an Ensemble Template if the template involves plotting of data for an ensemble. Otherwise the template is categorized as a Summary Case template. Ensemble Templates are listed with the icon while Summary Case templates are listed with the icon in the Templates Window, c.f. below.
Each summary plot template is stored in a single file on disk. ResInsight searches a set of directories for template files which are listed and managed by Plotting Preferences. Given a new path, ResInsight will ask the user to confirm whether the path of the stored template is to be included in subsequent searches for templates.
Template usage Right-clicking in Data Sources and clicking Create Summary Plot from Template will list available summary plot templates for selection. To reapply the previously used template, invoke Create Plot from Last Used Template or simply press Ctrl-T. Both approaces create a summary plot according to template.
Summary templates made with prior versions are incompatible with ResInsight 2022 due to significant extensions of functionality. Please load summary plots of prior versions via project files or re-establish plots prior to saving templates with ResInsight 2022.

Three types of completions are available for modeling and export: Perforation intervals, fishbone wells and fractures. The purpose of modeling these completions, is that it enables ResInsight to export Eclipse keywords for doing more refined simulations.
Completions can be modeled by adding new perforation intervals, fishbones subs or fractures. Details about the completions must then be specified, such as the length of the perforation interval or number of fishbone subs and laterals. After modeling the completions, the transmissibility (cell connection factors) can be calculated and exported to the Eclipse COMPDAT Keyword. See Export Completions
For fishbones completions, multi-segment well information can even be exported to the Eclipse Keywords WELSEGS, COMPSEGS and WSEGVALV, c.f. Export Well Segments.
The derived cell property Completion Type displays wich cells are intersected by the completions.
Visualization and Inspection of Well Connection Factors Connection factors both from the Simulation Wells and the ones calculated from the modeled completions can be visualized in the 3D view by enabling Well Connection Factors in the Project Tree. The connection factors are displayed with a symbol as in the example shown above. The color of the symbol displays the magnitude of the connection factor and can be controlled by the legend settings. Additional details of the connection factor are displayed in the Result Info window when clicking on the connection factor symbol.
The Property Panel of the Well Connection Factors item has a few options:
Geometry Scale Factor &ndash; Scales the connection factor symbols relative to the displayed well path radius Show on Closed Connections &ndash; Show the connection factors calculated for closed simulation well cells in addition to the ones at open cells. A combined view of well connection factors and the derived result Completion Type enables the user to see the completion type contributing to connection factor in a cell.
Perforation Intervals A new perforation interval on a well can be set up by right-clicking on the well in the 3D View or in the Project Tree, and choosing the command Create Perforation interval in the Create Completions sub-menu. In the 3D View the completion will be created at the specific depth the right-click occurred at.
After creating the perforation interval, the following properties of the perforation can be set in the property editor:
Start MD, End MD &ndash; Measured depth along the well path for the perforation to start/stop. Diameter &ndash; Well bore diameter for the perforation interval, used in calculation of transmissibility ( For details on the transmissibility calculation, see Transmissibility Calculations). Skin Factor &ndash; Skin factor for the perforation, used in calculation of transmissibility. All Timesteps &ndash; If on, the perforation interval will be present for all time steps Start Date &ndash; The perforation will be included in the model for all time steps after this date. If &ldquo;All TimeSteps&rdquo; is turned on, this option is not available and the perforation is included for all time steps. The perforation intervals will be indicated by different color along the well path.
For each well path there is a top level folder in the Project Tree containing all the perforation intervals definitions containing settings that applies to all the perforation intervals for this well path.
For multi-segment wells there are additional parameters which should be set. These are used in the export of WELSEGS data.
Multi Segment Well Options - Options used by the Well Segments Export Liner Inner Diameter &ndash; The liner inner diameter for the completion intervals. Roughness Factor &ndash; The roughness factor used in export of main bore segments. Pressure Drop &ndash; can be either Hydrostatic, Hydrostatic + Friction or Hydrostatic + Friction + Acceleration. Length and Depth &ndash; Used in WELSEGS export - when specifying the length and depth change for each segment Incremental &ndash; length / depth of given segment Absolute &ndash; the length down the tube or depth of the last nodal point Enforce Max Segment Length &ndash; Limit segment to max size. When this check box is checked, a max segment length input field is displayed. There are three options for Non-Darcy Flow. None, User defined D-factor and Compute D-factor. The second option displays an input field where the user defined D-factor can be entered. The last options calculates D-factor for gas given Dake´s (1976) radiel inflow model and correlation for calculating matrix beta factor depending on permeability and porosity.
Non-Darcy Flow - Non-Darcy settings for D factor computation Grid Permeability Kr Scaling Factor &ndash; Rel.perm. scaling factor to calculate effective permeability. Well Radius &ndash; Well bore radius. Relative Gas Density Gas Viscosity &ndash; Gas viscosity at flowing bottom hole pressure. Inertial Coefficient &ndash; Coefficient to calculate beta factor. Permeability Scaling Exponent &ndash; For beta factor calculation. Porosity Scaling Exponent &ndash; For beta factor calculation. Perforation Interval Valves Perforation Intervals can have valves (ICDs/AICDs/ICVs) associated with them.
These valves can be created by right-clicking on the Perforation Interval and selecting Create Valve.
Each Valve require a Valve Template containing properties which can be shared among multiple Valves. If you have no Valve Template, a new one can be created by clicking the New button next to the Valve Template selection list.
This will create a new Valve Template which can be of three different types:
ICD - In-flow Control Device, allowing the setting of Orifice Diameter and Flow Coefficient. ICDs are displayed in Orange. AICD - Autonomous In-flow Control Device, providing several more parameters associated with the Eclipse simulation and seen in the picture below. AICDs are displayed in Dark Purple. ICV - Interval Control Valves. Contains the same parameters as ICDs. The difference between the two in ResInsight is that many ICDs can be added at the same time, while there is only expected to be one ICV per perforation interval. ICVs are displayed in Pink. An example of the ICD parameters can be seen below: An example of the AICD parameters: AICD valves can be imported from Completor or Eclipse text files from the right-click menu of Valves.
New templates can also be added by selecting the New Valve Template option from the right-click menu of the Valve Templates entry in the Completion Templates Project Tree item.
For ICDs and AICDs, multiple valves can be added in the same go by specifying the number of valves, spacing of valves or specific positions of valves as chosen in the Location Defined By drop down list.
For ICVs only one valve is added at a time so only the measured depth of that valve can be chosen.
When you have a valid valve template selected, there is an Edit button next to the valve template selection. Clicking this will take you straight to modify the valve template.
Import Perforation Intervals Perforation intervals can be imported into ResInsight from *.ev files. These files consist of a list of wells, and their corresponding measured depth values for perforation start and end.
Perforation Interval File Format &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; is interpreted as the start of a comment. The comment ends at the end of the line. The files can start with a unit definition line:

Each set of holes created at the same location along the main bore, is referred to as a sub while each individual hole is called a lateral.
For each well path there is a top level folder in the Project Tree containing all the Fishbones definitions containing settings that applies to all the fishbones for this well path. To make use of the Multi Segment Well option for pressure loss along laterals, the grid resolution needs to be fine enough to allow a grid cell to be connected to only one lateral.

Import Well Trajectories as Fishbones Laterals The command Import Completions From File can be used to import well trajectories in the *.dev format as fishbone laterals. The imported laterals are listed under the folder Imported Laterals in the Project Tree. These laterals behave as completions, and will be exported when exporting completion data using the settings in the property panel of the Imported Laterals folder.
Export Fishbones as Well Trajectories The Export Laterals command will export the fishbone laterals as a well trajectory into a *.dev* -file.
Notice that only the trajectory data is exported. Properties related to well segment data or Completion Data export can not be written to .dev files.
Fractures Hydraulic fractures are completions created by pressurizing the reservoir at a certain point in the well, and thereby creating a crack in the formation. A substance is then injected into the crack to keep it open when relaxing the pressure.
Fractures in ResInsight can be added both to simulation wells and Well Trajectories, and have two main types: Elliptical fractures and StimPlan fractures.
Visualization control The Fractures item in the Project Tree controls whether to show the modeled fractures or not. For fractures along the well path the Perforation Length is shown as an olive green cylinder around the well path as shown in the image below.
Colors &ndash; Control the color settings for the fractures in the View Result Variable &ndash; Selects the fracture result to use for coloring the fracture. This is most interesting when you have imported a StimPlan fracture with varying width, conductivity and other parameters. The legend item in the Project Tree controls how the legend is set up. Default Color &ndash; The color to use if the requested result is not available for some fracture. StimPlan Show Mesh &ndash; Toggles the visualization of the StimPlan mesh lines, showing the StimPlan cell borders Color Interpolation &ndash; Toggles interpolation of the StimPlan results. When Off, one color per StimplanCell is shown. When on, ResInsight interpolates the color between the cells. Fracture Templates To create a functioning fracture you first need a Fracture Template. The template collects settings that are likely to be shared among several fractures, most importantly the fracture geometry. A fracture at a particular place refers to the template, and it is thereby possible to share fracture geometry and other settings between fracture instances.
Fracture Templates are listed in a folder with the same name in the Project Tree.
To create a new fracture template, right-click the Fracture Template item in the tree, and select either New Ellipse Fracture Template or New StimPlan Fracture Template. If you have no existing fracture templates, you will be given the opportunity to create such templates through two buttons in the Fracture Property Editor as seen below.

<p>Three types of completions are available for modeling and export: Perforation intervals, fishbone wells and fractures. The purpose of modeling these completions, is that it enables ResInsight to export Eclipse keywords for doing more refined simulations.</p>
<p>Completions can be modeled by adding new perforation intervals, fishbones subs or fractures. Details about the completions must then be specified, such as the length of the perforation interval or number of fishbone subs and laterals. After modeling the completions, the transmissibility (cell connection factors) can be calculated and exported to the Eclipse COMPDAT Keyword. See <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/export/completionexport/"> Export Completions</a></p>
<p>For fishbones completions, multi-segment well information can even be exported to the Eclipse Keywords WELSEGS, COMPSEGS and WSEGVALV,

<h2 id="fractures">Fractures</h2>
<p>Hydraulic fractures are completions created by pressurizing the reservoir at a certain point in the well, and thereby creating a crack in the formation. A substance is then injected into the crack to keep it open when relaxing the pressure.</p>
<p>Fractures in ResInsight can be added both to simulation wells and Well Trajectories, and have two main types: Elliptical fractures and StimPlan fractures.</p>
<h3 id="visualization-control">Visualization control</h3>
<p>The <strong>Fractures</strong> item in the <strong>Project Tree</strong> controls whether to show the modeled fractures or not. For fractures along the well path the <strong>Perforation Length</strong> is shown as an olive green cylinder around the well path as shown in the image below.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fracture-templates">Fracture Templates</h3>
<p>To create a functioning fracture you first need a <strong>Fracture Template</strong>. The template collects settings that are likely to be shared among several fractures, most importantly the fracture geometry. A fracture at a particular place refers to the template, and it is thereby possible to share fracture geometry and other settings between fracture instances.</p>
<p>Fracture Templates are listed in a folder with the same name in the <strong>Project Tree</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/FractureTemplates.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To create a new fracture template, right-click the <strong>Fracture Template</strong> item in the tree, and select either <strong>New Ellipse Fracture Template</strong> or <strong>New StimPlan Fracture Template</strong>. If you have no existing fracture templates, you will be given the opportunity to create such templates through two buttons in the Fracture Property Editor as seen below.</p>

An ensemble is a group of cases that are tightly coupled, only a set of ensemble input parameters differ between cases. This makes it relevant to perform calculations and statistics analysis on ensembles.
Import There are several ways to import an ensemble:
Use menu option File-&gt;Import-&gt;Summary Cases-&gt;Import Ensemble Use menu option File-&gt;Import-&gt;Summary Cases-&gt;Import Summary Case group and then convert the group to an ensemble Import a number of summary cases, move them into a group and then convert the group to an ensemble During import of a summary case, ResInsight tries to find an associated parameters.txt file or runspecification.xml file containing ensemble parameters. If found, the ensemble parameters are stored together with the summary case. When the user adds a summary case to an ensemble, then ResInsight will perform ensemble parameters validation. A warning dialog is displayed in the following cases:
One or more of the cases in the ensemble have no ensemble parameters The list of ensemble parameters differ between cases in the ensemble Ensemble File Dialog
Best Practices Summary Data
Naming The name of an ensemble can be changed by interactive edit of the name in the Project Tree (by clicking or using F2) or selecting the ensemble and changing the name in the Property Editor.
Plotting Ensembles are plotted in the summary plot the same way as ordinary summary curves. Create a new summary plot using the summary plot editor. Imported ensembles will appear in a separate group in the list of summary cases. When an ensemble is selected, a new curve set is created and plotted as multiple summary curves. By default all curves in an ensemble curve set will have the same color.
A color selection dialog can be opened by clicking on the color icon in the Project Tree. The coloring mode may be edited in the curve set&rsquo;s property editor in the project plot tree view. Two coloring modes are available:
Single color Use the same color for all curves in a curve set Single color with Transparency Use transparency for the ensemble curves By Ensemble Parameter One ensemble parameter is selected to control coloring. The ensemble parameter value for each case is used to pick a color in a color range. In this case a color legend appears. By Objective Function Use the value of an objective function for colors. By Custom Objective Function Use the value of an objective function for colors. Stepping of data source for ensemble curves is described in Summary Plot Source Stepping
Objective Functions
Resampling Resampling of curves is possibly by selecting the actual curve(s) listed by the Ensemble Curve Sets item in Plot Project Tree and using the Resampling feature of Property Editor.
Statistics curves If the number of curves in a curve set is sufficient, ResInsight will calculate statistics for the curve set. The following statistics curves may be displayed:
P10 &ndash; 10% of the curves in the curve set are above this curve P50 &ndash; 50% of the curves in the curve set are above this curve Mean &ndash; Aritmetic mean for the curves in the curve set P90 &ndash; 90% of the curves in the curve set are above this curve Statistics curves may be toggled on or off in the curve set&rsquo;s property editor.
Delta Ensemble A new ensemble can be created based on calculations on two or more ensembles. Such an ensemble is called an Delta Ensemble. A delta ensemble will contain data which are either the sum or difference between two other ensembles. An existing delta ensemble may be input to a new delta ensemble, making it possible to, for instance, add more than two ensembles.
To create a delta ensemble, select two existing ensembles in Plot Project Tree, then right-click and select New Delta Ensemble. A new delta ensemble is created with the two selected ensembles as input and a default arithmetic operator. In the property for the delta ensemble, both input ensembles and operator can be modified. Checking Match On Parameters ensures strict match on ensemble parameters. In addition, it is possible to specify a fixed time step to be used in delta computation, see Delta Summary Case for an example.
If the two input ensembles differs in which cases they consist of, ResInsight will display a warning and let the user decide whether to create the delta ensemble or not.
`,html:`<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/plot-window/Ensemble.png" alt=""></p>
<p>An ensemble is a group of cases that are tightly coupled, only a set of ensemble input parameters differ between cases. This makes it relevant to perform calculations and statistics analysis on ensembles.</p>
<h2 id="import">Import</h2>
<p>There are several ways to import an ensemble:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use menu option <strong>File-&gt;Import-&gt;Summary Cases-&gt;Import Ensemble</strong></li>
<li>Use menu option <strong>File-&gt;Import-&gt;Summary Cases-&gt;Import Summary Case group</strong> and then convert the group to an ensemble</li>
<li>Import a number of summary cases, move them into a group and then convert the group to an ensemble</li>
</ul>
<p>During import of a summary case, ResInsight tries to find an associated <strong>parameters.txt</strong> file or <strong>runspecification.xml</strong> file containing ensemble parameters. If found, the ensemble parameters are stored together with the summary case. When the user adds a summary case to an ensemble, then ResInsight will perform ensemble parameters validation. A warning dialog is displayed in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>One or more of the cases in the ensemble have no ensemble parameters</li>
<li>The list of ensemble parameters differ between cases in the ensemble</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/best-practices/summarydata/">Best Practices Summary Data</a></p>
<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>The name of an ensemble can be changed by interactive edit of the name in the <strong>Project Tree</strong> (by clicking or using <strong>F2</strong>) or selecting the ensemble and changing the name in the <strong>Property Editor</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="plotting">Plotting</h2>
<p>Ensembles are plotted in the summary plot the same way as ordinary summary curves. Create a new summary plot using the <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/plot-window/summaryploteditor/">summary plot editor</a>. Imported ensembles will appear in a separate group in the list of summary cases. When an ensemble is selected, a new curve set is created and plotted as multiple summary curves. By default all curves in an ensemble curve set will have the same color.</p>
<p>A color selection dialog can be opened by clicking on the color icon in the <strong>Project Tree</strong>.
<img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/plot-window/ColorSelectionDialog.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The coloring mode may be edited in the curve set&rsquo;s property editor in the project plot tree view. Two coloring modes are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single color</strong> Use the same color for all curves in a curve set</li>
<li><strong>Single color with Transparency</strong> Use transparency for the ensemble curves</li>
<li><strong>By Ensemble Parameter</strong> One ensemble parameter is selected to control coloring. The ensemble parameter value for each case is used to pick a color in a color range. In this case a color legend appears.</li>
<li><strong>By Objective Function</strong> Use the value of an objective function for colors.</li>
<li><strong>By Custom Objective Function</strong> Use the value of an objective function for colors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stepping of data source for ensemble curves is described in <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/plot-window/summarysourcestepping/">Summary Plot Source Stepping</a></p>
<p><a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/plot-window/objectivefunctions/">Objective Functions</a></p>
<h3 id="resampling">Resampling</h3>
<p>Resampling of curves is possibly by selecting the actual curve(s) listed by the <em>Ensemble Curve Sets</em> item in <strong>Plot Project Tree</strong> and using the <strong>Resampling</strong> feature of <strong>Property Editor</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/plot-window/EnsemblePlottingResampling.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="statistics-curves">Statistics curves</h3>
<p>If the number of curves in a curve set is sufficient, ResInsight will calculate statistics for the curve set. The following statistics curves may be displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P10</strong> &ndash; 10% of the curves in the curve set are above this curve</li>
<li><strong>P50</strong> &ndash; 50% of the curves in the curve set are above this curve</li>
<li><strong>Mean</strong> &ndash; Aritmetic mean for the curves in the curve set</li>
<li><strong>P90</strong> &ndash; 90% of the curves in the curve set are above this curve</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistics curves may be toggled on or off in the curve set&rsquo;s property editor.</p>
<h2 id="delta-ensemble">Delta Ensemble</h2>
<p>A new ensemble can be created based on calculations on two or more ensembles.
Such an ensemble is called an <strong>Delta Ensemble</strong>.
A delta ensemble will contain data which are either the sum or difference between two other ensembles.
An existing delta ensemble may be input to a new delta ensemble, making it possible to, for instance, add more than two ensembles.</p>
<p>To create a delta ensemble, select two existing ensembles in <strong>Plot Project Tree</strong>, then right-click and select <strong>New Delta Ensemble</strong>.
A new delta ensemble is created with the two selected ensembles as input and a default arithmetic operator.
In the property for the delta ensemble, both input ensembles and operator can be modified.
Checking <em>Match On Parameters</em> ensures strict match on ensemble parameters.
In addition, it is possible to specify a fixed time step to be used in delta computation, see
<a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/plot-window/summaryplots/#delta-summary-case">Delta Summary Case</a> for an example.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/plot-window/DeltaEnsemblePropertyEditor.png" alt=""></p>

Octave functions that communicates with a running ResInsight session Features to simplify management and editing of Octave scripts from ResInsight Commands to execute scripts using Octave. The Octave functions are documented in Octave Interface Reference.
Note: The Octave interface does not support Flow diagnostics and Injection flooding results in addition to Geomechanical cases.
Octave Script Management Octave scripts are available in the Scripts folder in the Project Tree.
This folder contains an entry for each of the directories you have added as a Script Folder. Each of the folder lists available *.m files and sub directories.
Adding Script Folders You can add directories by right-clicking the Scripts item to access the right-click menu.
Multiple standard script folder locations can also be defined in the field Shared Script Folder(s) in the Preferences Dialog (Edit -&gt; Preferences).
Editing Octave Scripts To enable script editing from ResInsight you need to set up the path to a text editor in the Script Editor field in the Preferences Dialog (Edit -&gt; Preferences)
When done, scripts can be edited using the right-click menu command Edit on the script item in the tree.
If you add a script file directly by creating a new file, the new script can be made visible in the user interface by activating Refresh in the right-click menu of a script folder.
Executing Octave Scripts ResInsight can be instructed to execute an Octave script once as a one shot operation, or several times, one time for each selected case. The Octave Interface Reference highlights in more depth how to design your Octave scripts to utilize these features.
Executing a Script Once A script can be started by navigating to the script in the Project Tree, and selecting Execute from the right-click menu. The currently active case (The one with the active 3D View) will then be set as ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case, and the script is executed once.
Executing a Script for Each Selected Case One script can be executed on many cases by first selecting a set of cases, and then activating Execute script from the right-click menu on the case selection. The script is then executed once per selected case setting the ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case each time.
Process Monitor When an Octave script is executed, the Process Monitor pops up and displays the output from Octave during the script execution as displayed below:
In addition to the output from the script, it prints a start and stop time stamp. The Clear-button deletes all the text in the monitor, and the Stop-button tries to kill the running Octave process.

An Objective Function is used to color the curves of an ensemble plot in ResInsight to highlight characteristics by a function definition based on individual summary vectors. As shown in the example above, the legend relates colours to values as calculated by a particular objective function and shows the use and formula of the objective function in the plot.
Using Objective Functions Curve coloring by Objective Function is activated as shown below.
Objective Function
ResInsight uses the following objective function definition:
$ F = \\frac {1} {N} \\Sigma (\\frac{ \\mid (t_i - tH_i) \\mid }{ \\epsilon * tH_i } )^n $
$ t_i $ : Simulated value for time step $i$
$ tH_i $ : History (observed) value for time step $i$
$ N $ : Number of Observations
$ \\epsilon $ : Error estimate [0..100 %]
$ n $ : Either 1 - Basic error term, or 2 - Squared error term
The time step selection is either specified using Time Range (F1) to define all time steps in a time range or Selected Time Steps (F2)
Creating Custom Objective Functions It is also possible to create a Custom Objective Function to customize the coloring of ensemble plots:
Custom objective functions can express a weighted sum of the default objective functions (applied to any vector)
Custom objective functions allow for an arbitrary combination of weigthed default objective functions
Thus, $ M_{custom} = \\Sigma_i^N weight_i * f_i(vectors) $ where $ f_i \\in \\lbrace F1, F2 \\rbrace $
A Custom Objective Function is created by invoking the context menu on the Custom Objective Functions item in Plot Project Tree.
Adding a new weighted function expression to an existing objective function is performed by invoking the context menu as shown below.
Display settings Changing objective function can be performed by the property editor of actual ensemble. The property editor also allows toggling the display of formula by the Show Formula in Plot check-box and setting of time step range.
As seen below, selected range is displayed by color frame and labels in plot background. The range determines the time range for which the objective function is utilized for coloring the curves.

`,url:"/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/export/"},window.store["/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/scripting/octaveinterfacereference/"]={title:"Octave Interface Reference",content:`Introduction To identify a ResInsight case uniquely in the Octave script, an integer Id (CaseId) is used. This Id can be retrieved in several ways, but there are two main modes of operation regarding this for a particular octave script: Either the script is designed to work on a single case (the &ldquo;Current Case&rdquo;), or the script is designed to access the selection and traverse the cases by itself.
Note: The Octave interface does not support Geomechanical cases and flow diagnostic results.
Single Case Scripts Single case scripts do not need to address cases explicitly, but works on what ResInsight considers being the &ldquo;Current Case&rdquo;. When the user selects several cases and executes a script on them, ResInsight loops over all cases in the selection, sets the current case and executes the script. All references to the &ldquo;Current Case&rdquo; from the script will then refer to the case currently being processed by ResInsight. The Current Case can be accessed directly using riGetCurrentCase(), but the more direct way is to omit the CaseId parameter in the functions, the Current Case is then automatically used.
Multi Case Scripts Scripts can access the selection state in ResInsight, and also retrieve lists of Case Groups and cases including some meta information. This can be used if the scripts need to get values from some cases, and store the results in others, etc.
Case Types The case type (Labeled &ldquo;CaseType&rdquo; in the following specification) of a case is returned as a text string when retrieving lists of cases, and is one of the following:
Case Type Description ResultCase A binary Eclipse case InputCase A case based on ASCII Eclipse input data StatisticsCase A statistics case based on many source cases in Grid Case Group SourceCase A binary Eclipse case in a Grid Case Group Unresolved Issues The issue around having multiple instances of ResInsight is still not addressed, but might affect the function signatures by adding a port number parameter to all of them. We will try to find ways to avoid this, but are still not certain that we will succeed.
Specification Project Information The case information is presented in an octave Structure called CaseInfo, and contains the following fields:
CaseInfo = { CaseId = int # A project-unique integer used to address this # particular case CaseName = string # The name that has been assigned to the case # in ResInsight. CaseType = string # See the description above CaseGroupId = int # A project-unique integer identifying the # CaseGroup this case is a member of. # -1 if not in a CaseGroup. Valid only for # Statistics-, and SourceCases } CaseInfo riGetCurrentCase() This function returns a CaseInfo Structure for the Case considered being the &ldquo;Current Case&rdquo; by ResInsight. When ResInsight loops over a selection of cases and executes an Octave script for each of them, this function returns the CaseInfo for that particular Case.
Vector[CaseInfo] riGetSelectedCases() This function returns a CaseInfo Structure for each of the cases selected in ResInsight at the time when the script launched.
Vector[CaseGroupInfo] riGetCaseGroups() This function returns a CaseGroupInfo Structure for each of the case groups in the current ResInsight project.
CaseGroupInfo = { CaseGroupId = int # A project-unique integer used to address # this particular CaseGroup CaseGroupName = string # The name assigned to the CaseGroup # in ResInsight } Vector[CaseInfo] riGetCases([CaseGroupId]) This function returns a CaseInfo Structure for all the cases in the current ResInsight project, including the Statistics cases and Source cases in a Grid Case Group. If a CaseGroupId is provided, only the cases in that Case Group will be returned.
Retrieving Grid Metadata Matrix[numActiveCells][9] riGetActiveCellInfo([CaseId], [PorosityModel = &ldquo;Matrix&rdquo;|&ldquo;Fracture&rdquo;] ) This function returns a two dimensional matrix containing grid and IJK information about each of the active cells in the requested case. The columns contain the following information:
[GridIdx, I, J, K, ParentGridIdx, PI, PJ, PK, CoarseBoxIdx] GridIdx # The index of the grid the cell resides in. # Main grid has index 0 I, J, K # 1-based index address of the cell in the grid. ParentGridIdx # The index to the grid that this cell's grid # is residing in. PI, PJ, PK # 1-based address of the parent grid cell that # this cell is a part of. CoarseBoxIdx # 1-based coarsening box index, -1 if none. # Coarsening box info can be retrieved using # **riGetCoarseningInfo()** If the CaseId is not defined, ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case is used.
Matrix[numCoarseGroups][6] riGetCoarseningInfo([CaseId]) This function returns all coarse box definitions used in the grid. The columns contain the following information: [I1, I2, J1, J2, K1, K2]: 1-based index addresses of the min and max corners of the coarsening box. If the CaseId is not defined, ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case is used.
Matrix[numGrids][3] riGetGridDimensions([CaseId]) This function returns a two dimensional matrix: One row for each grid, starting with the main grid.
NOTE: This means that the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; GridIndices where 0 means Main Grid does not work directly with this matrix. You have to add 1.
The columns contain the following information: [NI, NJ, NK]: I, J, K dimensions of the grid. If the CaseId is not defined, ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case is used.
Vector[TimeStepDate] riGetTimeStepDates([CaseId]) This function returns the date information for each of the time steps in the case as a Vector of Structures. The Structure is defined as:
TimeStepDate = { Year = int # The year eg. 2013 Month = int # The month. Eg. 12 Day = int # The day in the month. Eg. 24 Hour = int # The hour of the day. Eg. 17 Minute = int # The minute in the hour. Eg. 55 Second = int # The second within the minute. Eg. 30 } If the CaseId is not defined, ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case is used.
Vector[DecimalDay] riGetTimeStepDays([CaseId]) This function returns the time from the simulation start as decimal days for all the time steps as a Vector of doubles. If the CaseId is not defined, ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case is used.
Retrieving Property Data Vector[PropertyInfo] riGetPropertyNames([CaseId] ], [PorosityModel = &ldquo;Matrix&rdquo;|&ldquo;Fracture&rdquo;]) This function returns the name and type of all the properties in the case as a Vector of Structures. The Structure is defined as:
PropertyInfo { PropName = string # Name of the property as received from # the analysis tool PropType = string # The type of the property: &quot;StaticNative&quot;, # &quot;DynamicNative&quot;, &quot;Input&quot;, &quot;Generated&quot; } If the CaseId is not defined, ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case is used.
Matrix[numActiveCells][numTimestepsRequested] riGetActiveCellProperty([CaseId], PropertyName, [RequestedTimeSteps], [PorosityModel = &ldquo;Matrix&rdquo;|&ldquo;Fracture&rdquo;]) This function returns a two dimensional matrix: [ActiveCells][Num TimestepsRequested] containing the requested property data from the case with CaseId. If the case contains coarse-cells, the results are expanded onto the active cells. If the CaseId is not defined, ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case is used. The RequestedTimeSteps must contain a list of indices to the requested time steps. If not defined, all the time steps are returned.

The &ldquo;TimeStepIndices&rdquo; argument is used to &ldquo;label&rdquo; all the time steps present in the supplied data matrix, and must thus be complete. The time step data will then be put into ResInsight at the time steps requested.
If the CaseId is not defined, ResInsight&rsquo;s Current Case is used.

`,html:`<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>To identify a ResInsight case uniquely in the Octave script, an integer Id (CaseId) is used. This Id can be retrieved in several ways, but there are two main modes of operation regarding this for a particular octave script: Either the script is designed to work on a single case (the &ldquo;Current Case&rdquo;), or the script is designed to access the selection and traverse the cases by itself.</p>

<div class="notices info" ><p><b>Note:</b> The Octave interface does not support Geomechanical cases and flow diagnostic results.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="single-case-scripts">Single Case Scripts</h3>
<p>Single case scripts do not need to address cases explicitly, but works on what ResInsight considers being the &ldquo;Current Case&rdquo;. When the user selects several cases and executes a script on them, ResInsight loops over all cases in the selection, sets the current case and executes the script. All references to the &ldquo;Current Case&rdquo; from the script will then refer to the case currently being processed by ResInsight.
The Current Case can be accessed directly using <strong>riGetCurrentCase()</strong>, but the more direct way is to <em>omit the CaseId parameter</em> in the functions, the Current Case is then automatically used.</p>
<h3 id="multi-case-scripts">Multi Case Scripts</h3>
<p>Scripts can access the selection state in ResInsight, and also retrieve lists of Case Groups and cases including some meta information. This can be used if the scripts need to get values from some cases, and store the results in others, etc.</p>
<h3 id="case-types">Case Types</h3>
<p>The case type (Labeled &ldquo;CaseType&rdquo; in the following specification) of a case is returned as a text string when retrieving lists of cases, and is one of the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Case Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ResultCase</td>
<td>A binary Eclipse case</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>InputCase</td>
<td>A case based on ASCII Eclipse input data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>StatisticsCase</td>
<td>A statistics case based on many source cases in Grid Case Group</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SourceCase</td>
<td>A binary Eclipse case in a Grid Case Group</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="unresolved-issues">Unresolved Issues</h3>
<p>The issue around having multiple instances of ResInsight is still not addressed, but might affect the function signatures by adding a port number parameter to all of them. We will try to find ways to avoid this, but are still not certain that we will succeed.</p>

Filters are used to control the visibility of cells in the 3D view. Two types of filters exist:
Cell Filter &ndash; Extracts subset(s) of grid cells Property Filter &ndash; Extracts cells with a property value matching a value range The visibility of cells connected to wells, and fences can be controlled from Simulation Wells.
(Not applicable for Geomechanical cases)
Common Properties Cell and Property Filters Filters can be turned on and off using their check-boxes in Project Tree and controlled by their corresponding Property Editor. The sequence of the filters can be rearranged by clicking the arrow icons of selected filter.
Cell Filters and Property filters can either be set to Include or Exclude the matching cells. The Include setting marks the cells as visible while the Exclude setting is used to remove cells from visualization regardless of other filters. The icon in front of each filter show a + or - sign to indicate Include or Exclude .
Cell Filters Cell Filters enables the user to define a set of visible regions in the 3D view. Each Include cell filter will add cells to the visualization and the resulting 3D view will show the union of all the Include cell filters.
A new cell filter can be added by invoking the right-click menu for the Cell Filters collection in Project Tree.
The available cell filters are:
Polygon Filter: Defining a filter by marking target points of a polygon in 3D view to include or exclude matching cells. The polygon can be defined as part of the filter or referencing a polygon defined in the Polygons collection.
User Defined Filter: Defining a filter by specifying explicit cells to include or exclude by their IJK-index.
Range Filter: Defining a filter to include or exclude cells by specifying IJK-ranges. For radial models, IJ represents angle and radius.
Slice Filter: Defining a filter to include or exclude a slice of cells in either I-, J-, or K-direction.
The following exemplifies the use of a Polygon Filter and target points. Target points are defined and manipulated in 3D view as decribed in User Defined Polyline Annotations. Vertically, the filter can be set to use the XY target positions or IJK-index of targeted cells. The actual filtering can be specified to whole cells inside polygon, cell center inside polygon, or any cell corner inside polygon.
A filter can be added directly from 3D View by right-clicking a cell using the displayed menu.
Below is a snapshot of the Property Editor for the Range Filter type of Cell Filter:
Filter Type &ndash; The filter can either make the specified range visible ( Include ), or remove the range from the View ( Exclude ). Grid &ndash; This option selects which of the grids the range is addressing. Apply to Subgrids &ndash; This option tells ResInsight to use the visibility of the cells in the current grid to control the visibility of the cells in sub-LGR&rsquo;s. If this option is turned off, Sub LGR-cells is not included in this particular Range Filter. The Start and Width labels in front of the sliders features a number in parenthesis denoting maximum available value. The Start labels show the index of the start of the active cells. The Width labels show the number of active cells from the start of the active cells.
Property Filters Property Filters applies to the results of the Cell Filters and limits the visible cells to the ones approved by the filter. For a cell to be visible it must be accepted by all property filters.
A new property filter is created by activating the right-click menu on Property Filters or by right-clicking inside a 3D view. The new property filter is based on the currently viewed cell result by default.
The name of the property filter is automatically set to &ldquo;propertyname (min .. max)&rdquo; as you edit the property filter.
The right-click command Apply As Cell Result on a property filter, sets the Cell Color Result to the same values as the selected property filter.
Below is a snapshot of the Property Editor of the Property Filter.
Property Value Range The filter is based on a property value range (Min - Max). Cells in the range are either shown or hidden depending on the Filter Type (Include/Exclude). Exclude-filters removes the selected cells from the View even if some other filter includes them.
Range Behavior for Flow Diagnostic Results Normally the available range in the sliders is the max and min of all the values in all the time steps. For Flow Diagnostics results, however, the available range is based on the current time step.
We still need to keep the range somewhat fixed while moving from time step to time step, so in order to do so ResInsight tries to keep the intentions of your range settings, as the available range changes. If either the max or min value is set to the limit, ResInsight will keep that setting at the limit even when the limit changes. If you set a specific value for the max or the min, that setting will keep its value, even if it happens to end up outside the available range at a time step.
Category Selection If the property is representing integer values, well tracer names or formation names , the property filter displays a list of available categories used to filter cells. The separate values can then be toggled on or off using the list in the Property Editor.
If it is more convenient to filter the values using a value range, toggle the Category Selection option off.

A new plot with a single Track and Curve is created matching active case and selected Well trajectory. Right-click Well Log Plots in the Plot Project Tree and select New Well Log Plot. A plot is created with one Track and Curve. Right-click Wells in the Project Tree and select Import-&gt;Import Well Logs from file. Each Well Log Plot can contain several Tracks, and each Track can contain several Curves.
Tracks and Curves can be organized using drag and drop of their entries in the Plot Project Tree. Tracks can be moved from one plot to another and you can alter the order of tracks within a Well Log Plot by drag and drop. In addition, Curves can be moved from one Track to another. Furthermore, copy and paste of a Well Log Plot, Track, and Curve is possible by right-clicking their entry.
Measured Depth (MD), True Vertical Depth (TVD), True Vertical Depth RKB (TVDRKB) and Pseudo Length (PL) All Tracks in the same Well Log Plot always display the same depth range, and share the True Vertical Depth (TVD) or Measured Depth (MD) setting. In the property panel of the plot, the exact depth range can be adjusted along with the depth type setting (TVD/MD).
Simulation Wells however, is using a Pseudo Length instead of the real Measured Depth when the depth type is MD, as the MD information is not available in restart files. The Pseudo Length is a length along the coarsely interpolated visualization pipe, and serves only as a coarse estimation of an MD-like depth. Pseudo length is measured from the simulation-wells first connection-cell (well head connection) to the reservoir. This is very different from MD, which would start at RKB or at sea level.
Depth Unit The depth unit can be set using the Depth unit option. Currently ResInsight supports Meter and Feet. The first curve added to a plot will set the plot unit based on the curve unit. Additional curves added to a plot will be converted to the plot unit if needed.
Depth Zoom and Pan The visible depth range can be panned using the mouse wheel while the mouse pointer hovers over the plot. Pressing and holding CTRL while using the mouse wheel will allow you to zoom in or out depth-wise, towards the mouse position.
Depth Marker Line If there are multiple tracks in the same plot, it can be useful to show a horizontal line across the plot based on the location of the mouse cursor. This can be activated from the Property Editor of a Well Log Plot.
Accessing Plot Data Right-click a Well Log Plot and select Show Plot Data to show a window containing the plot data in ascii format. The content of this window is easy to copy and paste into Excel or other tools for further processing.
It is also possible to save the ascii data to a file by selecting a Well Log Plot in the Plot Project Tree and use the right-click command Export Plot Data to Text File.
Tracks Tracks can be created by right-clicking a Well Log Plot and select New Track.
The settings of each Track is controlled by the Property Editor. The figure below shows settings for the middle Track shown in the figure at top of this page which is annotated by Formations in Category colors. For GeoMechanical models, adding formations will also indicate the sea level.
A track controls the x-axis range of the display which is set in the property panel. In addition to the range, logarithmic display is controlled by checking Logarithmic Scale, grid lines are controlled by the Show Grid Lines option.
It is also possible to visualize Well Attributes such as casing and liners. The following images show some of the possibilities in which the first track shows cross sections of a well and the second track shows a radial view labeled with formations.
Curves Curves can be created by right-clicking a Track in the Plot Project Tree or by the commands mentioned above. The two types of curves are Well Log Extraction Curves and Well Log LAS Curves.
Well Log Extraction Curves Extraction curves acts as an artificial well log curves. Instead of probing the real well, a simulation model is probed instead.
The property panel for an eclipse model is shown below:
The first group of options controls all the input needed to setup curve data extraction. The selection of result value is somewhat different between geomechanical cases and Eclipse cases. Time step can be specified for dynamic properties.
Curve visual appearance and naming is controlled by the Appearance and Curve Name sections. The display name of a curve is normally generated automatically. Optionally, Auto Name can be switched off to use the options below to tailor curve name.
Placing keyboard focus in the Time Step drop-down box allows you to use arrow keys or mouse wheel to quickly step through the timesteps while watching the changes in the curve.
Curve Extraction Calculation This section describes how the values are extracted from the grid when creating a Well Log Extraction Curve.
Extraction curves are calculated by finding the intersections between a well trajectory and the cell-faces in a particular grid model. Usually there are two intersections at nearly the same spot; the one leaving the previous cell, and the one entering the next one. At each intersection point the measured depth along the trajectory is interpolated from the trajectory data. The result value is retrieved from the corresponding cell in different ways depending on the nature of the underlying result.
For Eclipse results the cell face value is used directly. This is normally the same as the corresponding cell value, but if a Directional combined results is used ( See Derived Results ), it will be that particular face&rsquo;s value.
Abaqus results are interpolated across the intersected cell-face from the result values associated with the nodes of that face. This is also the case for integration point results, as they are directly associated with their corresponding element node in ResInsight.
Change Data Source for Plots and Curves It is possible to change some data source parameters in one go for either a full plot or several selected curves. To change the parameters for a whole plot use either the Data Source group in the Property Editor for the Well Log Plot or corresponding toolbar which is visible when a Well Log Plot or any of its children are selected. Changing parameters in the Data Source group for the plot will also change the source for Zonation/Formations and Well Path Attributes in addition to the data source for all Well Log Extraction Curves and Well Log LAS Curves. The source stepping icons allows to quickly step through cases, wells, and timesteps c.f. Summary Plot Source Stepping.
To change data source for curves, select the curves for which you wish to change source and select Change Data Source from the right-click menu. The following dialog will appear:
In both cases, the following parameters are available to change:
Case &ndash; Applies the selected case to all the curves. Trajectory Type &ndash; Sets whether to use Simulation Wells or Well Paths as a data source for all curves. Well Name &ndash; Applies this well path to all the curves. Time Step &ndash; Applies this time step to all the curves. Common for the different ways of changing data source is that if a parameter is not shared among all the curves, the drop down list will show &ldquo;Mixed Cases, &ldquo;Mixed Trajectory Types&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mixed Well Paths&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mixed Time Steps&rdquo; to indicate that the curves have different values for that parameter. It is still possible to select a common parameter for them which will then be applied across the curves.
Well Log RFT Curves Well Log RFT Curves shows the values in a RFT file. See RFT Plot for details about RFT. A curve in a RFT plot will look identical to a RFT curve in a well log plot, if the depth type of the well log plot is TVD, and the interpolation type of the curve is Point to Point.
Well Log LAS Curves LAS-curves shows the values in a particular channel in a LAS-file.
The property panel of a LAS-curve is shown below:
You can also create a LAS-curve by a simple drag-drop operation in the Project Tree: Drag one of the LAS channels and drop it onto a Track. A new curve will be created with the correct setting.
LAS-file Support Importing LAS-files See Importing Well Log Files for details on LAS file import.
Exporting LAS-files A set of curves can be exported to LAS files by right-clicking the curves, well log track, or well log plots in Plot Project Tree and select Export To LAS Files &hellip;. An export dialog is displayed, allowing the user to configure how to export curve data.
Export Folder &ndash; Location of the exported LAS files, one file per unique triplet of well path, case and time step. Resampling &ndash; If enabled, all curves are resampled at the given resample interval before export. TVDRKB &ndash; If enabled, TVDRKB for all curves based on the listed well paths are exported. If the difference field is blank, no TVDRKB values are exported. `,html:`<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/plot-window/WellLogPlotOverview.png" alt=""></p>
<p>ResInsight can display well logs by extracting data from a simulation model along a well trajectory and from imported LAS-files. Extracted simulation data can be exported to LAS-files for further processing.</p>

The equations can be used to forecast future reservoir and well production.\nBased on the value of $b$ in the function, Arps classified the decline curves into three types:\nThe exponential decline has $b = 0$. The harmonic decline has $b = 1$. The hyperbolic decline has $b$ ranges between 0 and 1. It is important to note that the decline curve is an empirical model and assumes a simplified representation of the complex physical and geological factors affecting production decline.\nRate-Time Decline Curves Exponential Decline Exponential decline is the production decline when $ b = 0 $. This gives a constant decline ($D_i = D$).\n$$q_0 = q_i e^{-Dt }$$\nHyperbolic Decline Hyperbolic decline is the generic case where $ 0 &lt; b &lt; 1 $.\n$$q_0 = \\frac{q_i}{ (1+bD_i t )^\\frac{1}{b} }$$\nHarmonic Decline Harmonic decline is the production decline when $b = 1$:\n$$q_0 = \\frac{q_i}{ (1+D_i t ) }$$\nRate-Cumulative Production Decline Curves Exponential Decline Exponential decline is the production decline when $b = 0$.

Using production rate and time data the value is the slope of the straight line on a semi-log plot. Taking two points on from the data $(t_1, q_1)$ and $(t_2, q_2)$:\n$$D_i = \\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1} \\ln(\\frac{q_1}{q_2})$$\nwhere:\n$t_1$ is the time of the first point. $q_1$ is the production rate in the first point. $t_2$ is the time of the second point. $q_2$ is the production rate in the second point.

Intersections are cross sections of a grid model that cut the grid in various ways to display grid cell values. There are two main types of intersections:
Intersection: is defined by a piece-wise linear curve and a direction of extrusion. The curve can be either a simulation well, a well path, a user defined polyline, or a user defined line. An intersection can also be shown in a separate 2D Intersection View.
Intersection Box: can be used as a box cutting grid cells or collapsed to a restricted axis aligned plane.
Structural uncertainty can be visualized on intersections as described in Ensemble Surface.
All types of intersections are stored in the folder Intersections of a View. An intersection may be copied to other views by the menu option Copy intersections to all views in case in the right-click menu.
Curve Based Intersections There are four types of curve based intersections: Well Path, Simulation Well, Polyline, and Azimuth and Dip. Azimuth and Dip differs from the other three curves, as it is defined just by one straight line. It is called Azimuth and Dip because the plane&rsquo;s extrusion direction can be defined by the two angles.
Any of these intersections can be created by activating New Intersection from the right-click menu of the Intersections item in the Project Tree. They can also be created from the right-click menu in the 3D view, as described below.
To be able to see the intersections in the 3D view, the grid cells can be hidden by disabling the Grids item in Project Tree or activating the Hide Grid Cells toolbar button.
Common Curve Based Intersection Options The property panel of a well path based intersection is shown below:
Name &ndash; Automatically created based on the item specifying the intersection. The user can edit the name, but it will be updated if you change well or well path. Intersecting Geometry &ndash; Options to control the curve used for the cross section dependant on the type of intersection. Depth Filter &ndash; Controls the depth/z-range for visible geometry. Can be controlled from the Intersections folder object. K Range Filter &ndash; Controls the visible K slices. Can be controlled from the Intersections folder object. Advanced options Direction &ndash; Horizontal, vertical or defined by two points. Extent Length &ndash; Defines how far an intersection for well path or simulation Well is extended at intersection ends. Show Inactive Cells &ndash; Controls if inactive cells are included when creating intersection geometry. Direction is used to extrude the curve in the defined direction, and thereby create a set of planes. Horizontal implies the start and end point of the curve is used as a baseline, and the horizontal direction is thus perpendicular to that line. By Defined by two points, the user can define the direction based on any two points. The direction from the first to the second point defines the extrude direction.
Well Path Intersections A new Well Path intersection can be created by right-clicking the well path in the 3D view or in the Project Tree.
A new Simulation Well intersection can be created by right-clicking the simulation well in the 3D view or in the Project Tree.
When a simulation well intersection is created, the source simulation well can be changed by using the Simulation Well selection combo box in the Property Editor.
If the well contains more than one branch, the intersection geometry will be created for the selected branch in the Branch combo box.
Polyline Intersection A new Polyline intersection can be created from the right-click menu in the 3D view. Then, by left-clicking on reservoir geometry, a polyline is created. The points are added to the point list in the Property Editor.
The background color of point list is light pink when additional points can be picked in 3D view. To finish adding points, click button Stop picking points (color of point list turns white). The points in the list can be deleted and edited using the keyboard. To append more points (by clicking in the 3D view), press button Start picking points again.
The point list can be copied to clipboard using CTRL-C when in keyboard focus. A new list of points can be pasted into the point list by using CTRL-V.
Polygon Intersection A polyline or polygon intersection can also be based on a Polygons in the project. The polygon is then used as the polyline. This is done by selecting the polygon in the Property Editor.
Azimuth and Dip A new Azimuth and Dip intersection can be created from the right-click menu in 3D view. Then, by left-clicking two points on reservoir geometry, a single line is created between the first point, and the second point projected down to the plane with same z-value as the first point. The two points are added to the point list in the Property Editor.
The background color of point list is light pink when additional points can be picked in 3D view. To finish adding points, click button Stop picking points (color of point list turns white). The points in the list can be deleted and edited using the keyboard. To append more points by clicking in the 3D view, press button Start picking points again.
The points in the list can be copied to clipboard using CTRL-C when in keyboard focus. A new list of points can be pasted into the point list by using CTRL-V.
When two points are picked, a plane between the points will appear in the 3D view with a 90 degrees Dip, and the Azimuth angle calculated from the two points. The two angles can be edited in the Property Editor of the intersection:
Dip: angle between the horizontal plane and down. Azimuth: angle between North and the plane. Changing azimuth will rotate the plane about the first point picked in 3D view. The length of the plane can also be set manually in the Property Editor.
Length Up is the distance from the user defined horizontal line, to the top of the plane intersecting the model. Length Down is the distance from the user defined horizontal line, to the bottom of the plane intersecting the model. 2D Intersection Views A 2D Intersection View displays the intersection in a separate 2D view along with the defining curve. The intersection and the defining well path, simulation well or polyline is flattened to make it easier to see the intersected grid and how the well traverses it.
Each of the curve based intersections have a corresponding 2D Intersection View. Management of these views are automatic. They will be created and deleted along with the intersection.
A 2D Intersection View is shown either by right clicking an intersection and select Show 2D intersection View or by checking its entry in Project tree.
Scales along the edges of the view show the depth and the horizontal length of the intersection. The length is measured from the start of the wellpath or the well head of a simulation well.
The view is mostly controlled by the options in the 3D view where the intersection is defined. There are, however, some independent controls, like drawstyle, timestep and Z-scale:
Viewer Name &ndash; User editable name of view. The default name combines the name of the origin view and intersection name. Background &ndash; Color of the viewer background Disable Results Lighting &ndash; Toggle the light effect. When turned off, the colors are easier to compare with legend, but carry no visual cue to visualize 3D shape. The effect is tiny on 2D Intersection Views. Grid Appearance &ndash; Controls the drawstyle of the grid geometry Z Scale &ndash; Scales the view in Z(depth) direction to make slim K-layers easier to see Grid Lines &ndash; Controls what mesh lines to draw All &ndash; All mesh lines are drawn Faults Only &ndash; Only mesh lines associated with faults are drawn None &ndash; Mesh lines are not drawn at all Grid Surface &ndash; Controls what grid surface geometry to draw All &ndash; All grid faces are drawn Faults Only &ndash; Only faces that are included in a fault is drawn None &ndash; Do not draw any faces Defining Points Show points &ndash; Toggle the display of the defining points for Polyline or Azimuth and Dip intersections. These options are similar to the options for a regular 3D view (See View Properties )
Intersection Box and Intersection Planes A new Intersection Box or Intersection Plane can be created from the right-click menu in the 3D view or the right-click menu in the Project Tree.
The following list describes the properties for an Intersection Box:
Name &ndash; Automatically created based on the item specifying the intersection Box Type &ndash; Box or x-plane, y-plane or z-plane Show Inactive Cells &ndash; Controls if inactive cells are included when creating intersection geometry X Coordinates &ndash; Coordinates for x range Y Coordinates &ndash; Coordinates for y range Depth &ndash; Coordinates for depth range XY Slider Step Size &ndash; Defines incremental changes for slider when XY values are changed (default value 1.0) Depth Slider Step Size &ndash; Defines incremental changes for slider when depth values are changed (default value 0.5) Direct interaction in a 3D view is activated when Show 3D manipulator is pressed. Handles are displayed at the sides of the intersection object, and interactive modification is done by dragging a handle in the 3D view.
Depth and Range Filter An intersection can be visually filtered, i.e. partly hidden from display, by employing a user defined Depth Filter. Depth filtering is performed by selecting an intersection in Project Tree and setting Depth Filter properties in Property Editor:
None: no depth filtering Above: show above the specified Depth Below: show below the specified Depth Between: show between the specified Upper Depth and the specified Lower Depth An intersection can be also be visually filtered by a user defined K Range Filter. K Range filtering is performed by enabling K Range Filter of an intersection. The filtering is defined using a text string, i.e. &ldquo;5,10-15,20:3&rdquo;, see Advanced Text Input for details.
Filter Options for all Intersections The filtering of all intersections can be controlled when selecting the Intersections folder object. Activating these options will override the settings defined locally on each intersection.
Similar options can also be activated for Faults.
Intersection Results To select a simulation result to display on an intersection, right-click Intersection Results in Project Tree and select New Result Definition.
By selecting a specific Intersection Result, the Property Editor allows to specify case, type or position etc depending on whether the result stem from an Eclipse case or a Geomechanical case.
The next step is to select an Intersection in Project Tree and define Result Reference. In the example below, available sources are the two Intersections Results of previous figure, one of which stems from a geomechanical case and the other from an Eclipse case.

<h2 id="depth-and-range-filter">Depth and Range Filter</h2>
<p>An intersection can be visually filtered, i.e. partly hidden from display, by employing a user defined <strong>Depth Filter</strong>.
Depth filtering is performed by selecting an intersection in <strong>Project Tree</strong> and setting <strong>Depth Filter</strong> properties in <strong>Property Editor</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>None</strong>: no depth filtering</li>
<li><strong>Above</strong>: show above the specified <em>Depth</em></li>
<li><strong>Below</strong>: show below the specified <em>Depth</em></li>
<li><strong>Between</strong>: show between the specified <em>Upper Depth</em> and the specified <em>Lower Depth</em></li>
</ul>
<p>An intersection can be also be visually filtered by a user defined <strong>K Range Filter</strong>.
K Range filtering is performed by enabling <strong>K Range Filter</strong> of an intersection. The filtering is defined using a text string, i.e. &ldquo;5,10-15,20:3&rdquo;, see <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/misc/advancedtextinput/">Advanced Text Input</a> for details.</p>

<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/IntersectionFolderOverrides.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The filtering of all intersections can be controlled when selecting the <strong>Intersections</strong> folder object. Activating these options will override the settings defined locally on each intersection.</p>
<p>Similar options can also be activated for <strong>Faults</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="intersection-results">Intersection Results</h2>
<p>To select a simulation result to display on an intersection, right-click <strong>Intersection Results</strong> in <strong>Project Tree</strong> and select <strong>New Result Definition</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/SeparateIntersectionResults.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By selecting a specific <strong>Intersection Result</strong>, the <strong>Property Editor</strong> allows to specify case, type or position etc depending on whether the result stem from an Eclipse case or a Geomechanical case.</p>
<p>The next step is to select an <strong>Intersection</strong> in <strong>Project Tree</strong> and define <strong>Result Reference</strong>.
In the example below, available sources are the two <strong>Intersections Results</strong> of previous figure, one of which stems from a geomechanical case and the other from an Eclipse case.</p>

In addition to single curves, regression anaysis is also supported on ensemble statistics curves and Cross Plot curves.\nRegression Types Linear Regression The linear regression (i.e. straight line fit) is calculated by choosing the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed dependent variable values and the values predicted by the linear equation. The straight line equation can be written as:\n$$ y = a + bx $$\nwhere:\n$y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $a$ is the intercept, $b$ is the slope. Polynomial Regression Polynomial regression is a form of linear regression where the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. It allows for more complex relationships between the variables by introducing polynomial terms into the regression equation.\nA polynomial in a single indeterminate x can always be written (or rewritten) in the form\n$$ y = a_{n}x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0} $$\nwhere:\n$a_0 , \\ldots, a_n$ are constants that are called the coefficients of the polynomial, $x$ is the indeterminate. $n$ is the degree of the polynomial. To determine the degree of the polynomial, one needs to consider the complexity of the relationship between the variables and the nature of the data. A higher degree polynomial can capture more intricate relationships but may also lead to overfitting if the model becomes too flexible.\nPolynomial regression can be beneficial when the relationship between the variables is curvilinear or nonlinear. By introducing polynomial terms, it can capture the curvature in the data and provide a better fit compared to simple linear regression.\nPower Fit Regression The Power Fit regression is described by the following equation:\n$$ y = ax^b $$\nwhere:\n$y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $a$ is the coefficient, $b$ is the exponent. In power fit regression, the goal is to estimate the values of $a$ and $b$ that best describe the relationship between the variables. This is done by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed dependent variable values and the values predicted by the power-law equation.\nExponential Regression Exponential regression is a type of nonlinear regression used to model relationships where the dependent variable changes exponentially with the independent variable. It is suitable when the data exhibits exponential growth or decay patterns.\nThe equation for exponential regression can be written as:\n$$ y = ae^{bx} $$\nwhere:\n$y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $a$ is the coefficient, $b$ is the rate of growth or decay, $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828). Exponential models are commonly used in biological applications, for example, for exponential growth of bacteria. Spotfire uses a nonlinear regression method for this calculation. This will result in better accuracy of the calculation compared to using linear regression on transformed values only.\nLogarithmic Regression The logarithmic fit calculates the least squares fit through points by using the following equation:\n$$ y = a + b \\ln( x ) $$\n$y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, $a$ and $b$ are coefficients.

Polygons in Project A polygon is available for all views in a project. The polygons can be imported from file, exported to file or created by interactively clicking in a view.
Create a Polygon To create a polygon, the user clicks on a set of locations in 3D. This operation can be started by:
Right-click on some geometry in a view, from the menu select Polygon Right-click on Polygons in the Project Tree and select Create Polygon This will enable a mode where the user can click in the view to create a polygon. Small objects are created, and can be used to manipulate the location of a point. Left-click the pink circle and hold + mouse move will move a point in XY plane, left-click the blue cone and hold + mouse move will move a point in Z.
When completed, the user can click on the button Stop Picking Points in the Property Editor.
Duplication and Simplification Polygons can be duplicated by using the right-click menu. Imported polygons can have very many coordinates. To reduce the number of points, the user can select Simplify Polygon from the right-click menu. The simplification is done by removing points that are close to each other, but still conserves the overall shape of the polygon. The user can define a threshold to control the simplification. A larger value will remove more points, and a smaller value will remove fewer points.
Create Intersection and Polygon Cell Filter The user can create a grid intersection by using the Create Polygon Intersection. This will create an intersection of the polygon with the grid.
The user can also create a polygon cell filter by using the Create Polygon Cell Filter. This will create a polygon that represents the cells that are inside the polygon.
Polygon Intersection
Polygon Filter
Appearance Appearance settings are available by selecting the project polygon. Name, color, line style and other visual settings can be set in the Property Editor.
A polygon is by default defined as a closed loop of line segments. The user can choose to display the polygon as a closed loop or as a polyline using the Closed Polygon option in the Property Editor.
Import and Export Polygons can be imported from file and exported to file. The file format is either POL or CSV. The file format is automatically detected from the file extension. The user can also select the file format manually.
Import and export is available from the right-click menu of Polygons in the Project Tree. Polygons imported form file is marked with a padlock icon in the Project Tree. This indicates that the polygon is read-only and cannot be edited. A copy of the polygon can be created by using the right-click menu.
Polygon File Format - POL Define each point as three double per line (X Y Depth). Comment lines are supported by using # at the start of the line. Multiple polygons can be defined in the same file by using 999 999 999 as a separator.

ResInsight is capable of mapping properties and simulation results onto 3D surfaces imported from GOCAD and Petrel as specified below.
Import and appearance of surfaces 3D surfaces from GOCAD and Petrel are imported into ResInsight by the menu option File-&gt;Import-&gt;Import Surfaces in the 3D Main Window.
Imported surfaces are listed under the entry in the Project Tree. You can click on a surface to change i.e. the name or color of the surface, or change the file to read the surface data from.
You can also change the depth of the surface by adding a depth offset (positive or negative). This could be used i.e. to import the same surface file multiple times and assign each instance of the surface a separate depth offset. When a depth offset is set, the offset value will be shown as part of the surface name in the project tree.
Multiple surfaces can be imported at the same time by choosing more than one input file in the file selection window that shows up when you start an import.
Using folders To make it easier to organize the surfaces you import into your project, ResInsight supports creating surface folders in the project tree. To create a new folder, right-click on the top level Surfaces folder in the project tree and choose Add Folder.
Surface Results Per default, ResInsight maps current Cell Result on a given surface. If another result is to be displayed, specify the result under Surface Results as shown below.
Clicking a surface of a View in the Project Tree activates the Property Editor for allowing view settings as shown below.
To change result displayed on the surface, please specify the desired result in the Result Reference section of the Property Editor.
Reloading Surfaces If you have modified a surface file using an external program, you can easily load the changes into ResInsight by using the reload surface feature. Bring up the right-click menu for the surface you want to reload and choose Reload. The views will automatically update with the new data (could take a few seconds).
Create a copy You can easily create a copy of an existing surface by choosing Create Copy in the surface right-click menu. A new, identical surface will show up at the same level in the project tree. You can now give it a new name, change depth offset etc.
Grid Case Surfaces In addition to importing surfaces from file, ResInsight can also generate grid case surfaces. You do that by bringing up the right-click menu for the project tree entry and choose Create Grid Case Surfaces.
A grid case surface has the same properties as a surface imported from file, but instead of choosing which file the data should come from, you choose a source case, a slice direction and a slice index. The slice direction and index will be added to the surface name shown in the project tree.
Exporting Surfaces ResInsight can export surfaces to the GOCAD TSurf file format. Grid case surfaces can additionally be exported to Petrel Surface PTL format. Use the right-click menu for the surface you want to export and choose the export format you want to use. A file selection window will show up allowing you to choose where you want to save the exported data.
Supported Surface Formats GOCAD Surface format GOCAD is a computer application that allows you to import, create, modify, integrate, view, and export geological objects in 3D. The GOCAD export file format supported by ResInsight is TSURF (*.ts). A TSURF data file is a triangle based surface format containing vertex coordinates and triangle to vertex connectivities as exemplified below. ResInsight import vertex and triangle identifiers from the first TFACE section in such a file.

Fault Detection ResInsight always scans the grids for geometrical faults when they are loaded. When two opposite cell faces of I, J, K neighbor cells does not match geometrically, they are tagged.
All the tagged cell faces are then compared to the faults possibly imported from the *.DATA file in order to group them. If a particular face is not found among the fault faces defined in the *.DATA file (or their opposite faces), the cell face is added to one of two predefined faults:
Undefined grid faults Undefined grid faults With Inactive The first fault is used if both the neighbor cells are active. If one or both of the neighbor cells are inactive, the second fault is used.
These particular Faults will always be present, even when reading of fault information from the *.DATA file is disabled.
Information from *.DATA-files Fault Information If enabled in Preferences, ResInsight will import fault information from the *.DATA files and use this information to group the cell faces into named items. The imported faults are ordered in ascending order based on their name.
The DATA file is parsed for the FAULT keyword while respecting any INCLUDE and PATH keywords.
As import of faults can be time consuming, reading of faults can be disabled from Preferences-&gt;Import faults
NNC Data If enabled in Preferences, ResInsight will read Non Neighbor Connections from the Eclipse output file (*.INIT), and create explicit visualizations of those. The NNC&rsquo;s are sorted onto the Fault&rsquo;s and their visibility is controlled along with them.
When the NNCs are imported from file, ResInsight will identify NNCs not defined in the input file (Faces with zero transmissibility is not exported from the simulator). See Derived Results for details on other NNC related results.
Fault Visualization Options Fault Visibility Faults can be hidden and shown in several ways.
Checking or unchecking the checkbox in front of the fault will show or hide the fault. Visibility for multiple faults can be controlled at the same time by selecting multiple faults and use the right-click menu: On, Off and Toggle. Hide the fault from the right-click menu of a Fault in the 3D View. Fault Color Each named Fault is given a color on import. This color can be controlled by selecting the fault and edit its Fault color in the Property Editor.
Fault Result The default result mapping used on faults are to use the same as specified in Cell Result. If a different result mapping is wanted, enable the checkbox at Fault Result and select the result from the result selection dialog in the Property Editor. A second legend for the fault result is then added to the view.
Please note that the groups Fault Face Visibility and NNC Visibility are available below result selection.
Useful NNC results are descrived in Derived Results
Toolbar Control Visualization mode and mesh lines can be controlled from the toolbar.
Faults-Only visualization mode. When turned on, this option hides all the grid cells, and shows only the fault faces in the reservoir limited by the applied range and property filters. (Unless Show faults outside filters are turned on. See below.) Turns faces on and mesh off Turns on all faces, and shows mesh lines on faults only. This is a useful method to highlight the faults in your reservoir, because the faults stands out with black outlining. Shows labels for faults Faults Properties By clicking the Faults item in the Project Tree, the following options common to all the faults are displayed:
Fault Options Use Cell filters for Faults &ndash; When checked, use the currently active cell filters to filter the visible faults. Fault Labels Show labels &ndash; Displays one label per fault with the name defined in the *.DATA file Label color &ndash; Defines the label color Fault Face Visibility This group of options controls the visibility of the fault faces. Since they work together, and in some cases are overridden by the system, they can be a bit confusing.
First of all, these options are only available in Faults-only visualization mode ( See Toolbar Control ). When not in Faults-Only mode, ResInsight overrides the options, and the controls are inactive.
Secondly, the option you would normally want to adjust is Dynamic Face Selection ( See below ).
Show defined faces &ndash; Displays the fault cell faces that are defined on the Eclipse input file (*.DATA) Show opposite faces &ndash; Displays the opposite fault cell faces from what is defined on the input file, based on IJK neighbors.
These two options should normally be left On. They are useful when investigating the exact faults information provided on the *.DATA file. If you need to use them, it is normally wise to set the Dynamic Face Selection to &ldquo;Show Both&rdquo;. Dynamic Face Selection &ndash; At one particular position on a fault there are usually two cells competing for your attention: The cell closer to you as the viewer, or the one further from you. When showing results, this becomes important because these two cell faces have different result property values, and thus color.
This option controls which of the two cell faces you actually can see: The one behind the fault, or the one in front of the fault. There is also an option of showing both, which will give you an undefined mixture, making it hard to be certain what you see.
This means that ResInsight turns on or off the faces based on your view position and this option to make sure that you always see the faces (and thus the result property) you request. NNC Visibility Show NNCs &ndash; Toggles whether to display the Non Neighbor Connections, or not. Hide NNC geometry if no NNC result is available &ndash; Automatically hides NNC geometry if no NNC results are available The color of the NNC faces are set to be a bit lighter than their corresponding named fault, and can not be controlled directly.
Fault Export Faults can be exported to separate files in the *grdecl file format. This is useful for example if you need a list of the geometrically detected faults that has not been covered by entries in the eclipse FAULTS keyword.
To export some faults, select the faults you want to export in the Project Tree, and select the command Export Faults &hellip; from the right-click menu.
You are then prompted to select a destination folder. Each Fault is exported to a file named Faults_&lt;fault name&gt;_&lt;case name&gt;.grdecl and stored in the selected folder.
The fault name of Undefined Grid Faults is simplified to UNDEF, while Undefined Grid Faults With Inactive is simplified to UNDEF_IA. All other faults keep their original name.

 <strong>Faults</strong> item in the <strong>Project Tree</strong>, the following options common to all the faults are displayed:</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/FaultProperties.png" alt=""></p>
<h5 id="fault-options">Fault Options</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Cell filters for Faults</strong> &ndash; When checked, use the currently active cell filters to filter the visible faults.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="fault-labels">Fault Labels</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show labels</strong> &ndash; Displays one label per fault with the name defined in the <em><code>*.DATA</code></em> file</li>
<li><strong>Label color</strong> &ndash; Defines the label color</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="fault-face-visibility">Fault Face Visibility</h5>
<p>This group of options controls the visibility of the fault faces. Since they work together, and in some cases are overridden by the system, they can be a bit confusing.</p>
<p>First of all, these options are only available in <strong>Faults-only</strong> visualization mode ( See <a href="#toolbar-control">Toolbar Control</a> ). When not in <strong>Faults-Only</strong> mode, ResInsight overrides the options, and the controls are inactive.</p>
<p>Secondly, the option you would normally want to adjust is <strong>Dynamic Face Selection</strong> ( See below ).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show defined faces</strong> &ndash; Displays the fault cell faces that are defined on the Eclipse input file (<em><code>*.DATA</code></em>)</li>
<li><strong>Show opposite faces</strong> &ndash; Displays the opposite fault cell faces from what is defined on the input file, based on IJK neighbors.<br>
<em>These two options should normally be left <strong>On</strong>. They are useful when investigating the exact faults information provided on the <code>*.DATA</code> file. If you need to use them, it is normally wise to set the <strong>Dynamic Face Selection</strong> to &ldquo;Show Both&rdquo;.</em></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Face Selection</strong> &ndash; At one particular position on a fault there are usually two cells competing for your attention: The cell closer to you as the viewer, or the one further from you. When showing results, this becomes important because these two cell faces have different result property values, and thus color.<br>
This option controls which of the two cell faces you actually can see: The one behind the fault, or the one in front of the fault. There is also an option of showing both, which will give you an undefined mixture, making it hard to be certain what you see.<br>
This means that ResInsight turns on or off the faces based on your view position and this option to make sure that you always see the faces (and thus the result property) you request.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="nnc-visibility">NNC Visibility</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show NNCs</strong> &ndash; Toggles whether to display the Non Neighbor Connections, or not.</li>
<li><strong>Hide NNC geometry if no NNC result is available</strong> &ndash; Automatically hides NNC geometry if no NNC results are available</li>
</ul>

<div class="notices info" ><p>The color of the NNC faces are set to be a bit lighter than their corresponding named fault, and can not be controlled directly.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="fault-export">Fault Export</h2>
<p>Faults can be exported to separate files in the <em><code>*grdecl</code></em> file format. This is useful for example if you need a list of the geometrically detected faults that has not been covered by entries in the eclipse FAULTS keyword.</p>
<p>To export some faults, select the faults you want to export in the <strong>Project Tree</strong>, and select the command <strong>Export Faults &hellip;</strong> from the right-click menu.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/ExportFaultsMenu.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You are then prompted to select a destination folder. Each Fault is exported to a file named <em><code>Faults_&lt;fault name&gt;_&lt;case name&gt;.grdecl</code></em> and stored in the selected folder.</p>
<p>The fault name of <strong>Undefined Grid Faults</strong> is simplified to <em><code>UNDEF</code></em>, while <strong>Undefined Grid Faults With Inactive</strong> is simplified to <em><code>UNDEF_IA</code></em>. All other faults keep their original name.</p>

An RFT (Repeated Formation Tester) plot is a special well plot for comparing observed formation pressure and simulated formation pressure. The curves are plotted as pressure against true vertical depth (TVD) or measured depth (MD). Simulated pressure data is retrieved directly from the grid model or from the corresponding (*.rft) files, while observed pressure data are loaded from well log files (*.las).
Create New RFT Plot There are several ways to create new RFT Plots.
From the Project Tree in the Plot Main Window Select right-click command New RFT Plot for Well Path node or RFT Plots node. From the Project Tree in the 3D Main Window Select right-click command New RFT plot for a simulation well. From a 3D view Right-click a simulation well select Well Plots -&gt; New RFT Plot. Create Multiple RFT Plots ResInsight can automate the creation of multiple plots based on an already exising RFT plot.
Description of the workflow:
create a RFT plot for one well on the right-click menu of this plot, select Create Multiple RFT Plots a list of available wells is displayed, and the user can select the wells click OK, and the plots for selected wells are created Import Observed RFT Data Pressure Depth Data
A custom file format for Pressure Depth Data is supported.
LAS Pressure Data
To be able to plot observed pressure data for a well in an RFT plot, at least one well log file from that well (e.g. *.las) has to be imported to ResInsight. This file must contain a pressure column, which must have the name PRESSURE or PRES_FORM. If the well log file itself does not contain a TVD column (named TVDMSL), a well path file (See Well Trajectories) for the same well must also be imported to ResInsight.
If no TVD data for a well is found when the user tries to plot a curve, ResInsight will present a warning dialog to the user.
Property Editor The property editor lets the user select which curves to display in the RFT plot.
Well Name Select the well to display in the plot. Wells postfixed by &rsquo;(Well Path)&rsquo; have an associated well trajectory loaded.
Sources After a well has been selected in the Well Name field, the relevant sources for that well will appear in the sources field. The sources are placed in one of three different groups:
RFT File Cases &ndash; Simulation cases may have associated formation pressure data in *.rft file(s). If the simulation case contains such files, those are imported together with the simulation case (See the keyword WRFTPLT in the Eclipse manual for information). Grid Cases &ndash; The PRESSURE property in the 3D grid. Observed Cases &ndash; Observed data imported from well log files. When the user selects one or more sources, a selection of their time steps appears in the Time Steps field.
Time Steps The Time Steps field contains the relevant time steps according to the source selection. Time steps are deemed to be relevant by the following rules:
If a single source or sources of the same type are selected, all available time steps in those sources are shown. If sources from two or tree types are selected, the time steps are filtered: The time steps matching the observed case(s) time steps. If no time steps from a case match the observed time step, the two adjacent ones are shown. The first time step from any grid case(s) (as initial pressure reference). If the Observed data isn&rsquo;t selected, the RFT data serves as filter reference. Each time step is postfixed by an indication of which source type(s) the time step is belonging to. This indication is displayed as one or more letters within square brackets. Examples: [ O ], [ R G ].
O &ndash; Time step has observed data R &ndash; Time step has RFT data G &ndash; Time step has Grid data More than one letter for one single time step, means that the time steps comes from multiple case types.
Zonation/Formation Names This property editor lets the user control the visibility of formations lines. This is what it looks like in the RFT plot context.
Please see the full documentation on the formations property editor for details about formations.
When the formation names property editor is used in the context of RFT plots, the fields Trajectory and Simulation Well are hidden because those values are given by the RFT plot definition.
Legend and Axis This property editor lets the user control visual properties for the legend and axis.

This section will describe how to use formations for different k-layers of a case, and how to use well picks/zonations for ranges of measured depths of a well path.
Formations for k-layers Formation information can be utilized in ResInsight as cell colors, used in property filters and are displayed in the Result info panel when selecting single cells.
To use this functionality you will need to :
Import one or more Formation Names file(s) Select the correct Formation Names file in the Case of interest Import of Formation Names Files Formation Names files can be imported by using the command: File-&gt;Import-&gt;Import Formation Names.
Supported Formation Names files are:
Formation Names description files (*.lyr) FMU Layer Zone Table (layer_zone_table.txt) To select the appropriate file type, use the button to the right of file name in the Import Formation Names dialog. The imported Formation Names files are then listed in the Project Tree in a folder named Formations.
Formation Names description files (*.lyr) Formation Names description files (*.lyr) consist of a list of entries containing formation name, k-range, and optionally a formation color. Formation color can be given as a World Wide Web Consortium SVG color keyword name or a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to represent the red, green and blue components of the color, c.f. example below:
-- Any text as comment &#39;My First Formation Name&#39; 4 - 12 red &#39;My Second Formation Name&#39; 15 - 17 green &#39;Formation spanning 3 k-layers, i.e. 18,19 and 20&#39; 3 blue &#39;Last Formation Name&#39; 21 - 21 #FFFF00 FMU Layer Zone Table (layer_zone_table.txt) The FMU Layer Zone Table (layer_zone_table.txt) contains two columns to correlate each grid k-layer with a formation name. Below is an example of a layer_zone_table.txt file:
1 UpperReek 2 UpperReek 3 UpperReek 4 UpperReek 5 UpperReek 6 MidReek 7 MidReek 8 MidReek 9 MidReek 10 MidReek 11 LowerReek 12 LowerReek 13 LowerReek 14 LowerReek Select the Formation File in a Case If only one formation file is imported, the formation will automatically be set in the active view&rsquo;s case. If more than one formation file is imported at once, or if a case must change formation file, the formation file for a case can be set later on. This option is available in the Property Editor for a case. The formation is selected in the combo box for property Formation Names File.
Reload of formation data If the formation file is modified outside ResInsight, the formation data can be imported again by the right-click menu Formations-&gt;Reload. This command will import formations for the selected formation files.
Viewing the Formation Information Formations in 3D View The formations can be visualized as a result property in Cell Results, Cell Edge Result, and Separate Fault Result. When selected, a special legend displaying formation names is activated.
Property Filter Based on Formations Formation names are available in Property Filters as Result Type Formation Names. This makes it easy to filter geometry based on formation specifications.
See Cell Filters for details.
Picking in 3D View Picking on a cell being part of a formation will display the formation name in the Result Info windows, in addition to other pick info for the cell.
Annotations on Plots Formation can be used to annotate the following plot types:
Well Log Plots RFT Plots PLT Plots For RFT and PLT Plots, Zonation/Formation Names can be found in the plot&rsquo;s Property Editor. Tick &ldquo;Show Formations&rdquo; and choose the case with the desired formations.
In Well Log Plots and Well Allocation Plots, Zonation/Formation Names can be found in the Property Editor for a Track or Branch. In addition to choosing case, the path to show formations for must also be selected, as each track can have curves with data from more than one path.
Well Picks Well Picks can be set for a single well path, defined on measured depths of the well path. Unlike formations for k-layers, formations for a well path can only be used to annotate plots. A well pick can be either a fluid or a formation.
Import of Well Pick Files Well Pick files can be imported by using the command: File-&gt;Import-&gt;Well Data-&gt;Import Well Picks. The user is asked to select *.csv files for import.
The imported Well Pick files will be added to their associated well path, if a match on well name can be found. If not, new paths will be created, and they can all be found in Wells in the Project Tree. The file path of the formations can be found in a well path&rsquo;s Property Editor.
A Well Pick file is a csv-file, which uses semicolon to separate entries in a table. Below is an example of such a file:
Well name; Column name; Unit name; Top MD; Base MD B-3H; FLUID; GAS;2203.2;2317.4 B-3H; FLUID; OIL;2317.4;2459 B-3H; STRAT; FANGST GP. ;2203.399902;2223.350098 B-3H; STRAT; Ile Fm. ;2203.399902;2223.350098 B-3H; STRAT; Ile Fm. 3 ;2203.401123;2219.26001 B-3H; STRAT; Ile Fm. 2 ;2219.26001;2222.399902 B-3H; STRAT; Ile Fm. 2.2 ;2219.26;2219.350098 B-3H; STRAT; Ile Fm. 2.1 ;2219.350098;2222.399902 B-3H; STRAT; Ile Fm. 1 ;2222.399902;2223.350098 B-3H; STRAT; BAAT GP. ;2223.350098;2979.28125 B-3H; STRAT; Ror Fm. ;2223.350098;2285.199951 B-3H; STRAT; Ror Fm. 2 ;2223.350098;2246 B-3H; STRAT; Ror Fm. 1 ;2246;2285.199951 B-2H; FLUID; GAS;2144.4;2338.5 B-2H; FLUID; OIL;2338.5;2440 B-2H; STRAT; FANGST GP. ;2144.199951;2158.389893 B-2H; STRAT; Ile Fm. ;2144.199951;2158.389893 B-2H; STRAT; Ile Fm. 2 ;2144.201416;2156.197266 B-2H; STRAT; Ile Fm. 1 ;2156.197266;2158.38501 The file must have the columns &ldquo;Well name&rdquo;, &ldquo;Unit name&rdquo; (i.e. formation name), &ldquo;Top MD&rdquo; and &ldquo;Base MD&rdquo; (i.e. measured depth) to be regarded as a Well Pick file. They can be listed in any order, and all other columns will be ignorded.
The three unit names OIL, GAS and WATER are interpreted as fluids. Other unit names with only capital letters are groups. A unit name without an index is simply a formation. Unit names with one number is a formation 1, unit names with one punctuation is a formation 2, two punctuations, formation 3 and so on. Indentions in column name will be ignored.
Viewing the Well Picks See Annotations on plots. Annotations are added to plots in the same way as for k-layered formations, but the source is different.
In the Property Editor, choose Well Path as Source, and all well paths with formations will be shown in the drop-down list below. All disjoint well picks for the chosen well path is shown on default. To reduce the number of annotations, the Well Pick Filter can be used.
The Well Pick Filter will show formations down to the specified level. If more there are more than one formation within 0.1m of an MD, only the lowermost formation is shown. Well picks interpreted as Fluids are only shown by ticking the Show Fluids mark.

<p>This section will describe how to use formations for different k-layers of a case, and how to use well picks/zonations for ranges of measured depths of a well path.</p>
<h2 id="formations-for-k-layers">Formations for k-layers</h2>
<p>Formation information can be utilized in ResInsight as cell colors, used in property filters and are displayed in the <strong>Result info</strong> panel when selecting single cells.</p>
<p>To use this functionality you will need to :</p>
<ol>
<li>Import one or more Formation Names file(s)</li>
<li>Select the correct Formation Names file in the Case of interest</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="import-of-formation-names-files">Import of Formation Names Files</h3>
<p>Formation Names files can be imported by using the command: <strong>File-&gt;Import-&gt;Import Formation Names</strong>.</p>
<p>Supported Formation Names files are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formation Names description files (<em><code>*.lyr</code></em>)</li>
<li>FMU Layer Zone Table (<em><code>layer_zone_table.txt</code></em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>To select the appropriate file type, use the button to the right of file name in the <em>Import Formation Names</em> dialog.
The imported Formation Names files are then listed in the <strong>Project Tree</strong> in a folder named <strong>Formations</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="formation-names-description-files-_lyr_">Formation Names description files (<em><code>*.lyr</code></em>)</h4>
<p>Formation Names description files (<em><code>*.lyr</code></em>) consist of a list of entries containing formation name, k-range, and <em>optionally</em> a formation color.
Formation color can be given as a World Wide Web Consortium <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#ColorKeywords">SVG color keyword name</a>
or a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to represent the red, green and

<h2 id="well-picks">Well Picks</h2>
<p>Well Picks can be set for a single well path, defined on measured depths of the well path. Unlike formations for k-layers, formations for a well path can only be used to annotate plots. A well pick can be either a <em>fluid</em> or a <em>formation</em>.</p>
<h3 id="import-of-well-pick-files">Import of Well Pick Files</h3>
<p>Well Pick files can be imported by using the command: <strong>File-&gt;Import-&gt;Well Data-&gt;Import Well Picks</strong>.

ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D Plane. Any 3D result value can be aggregated, in addition to specialised results, such as oil, gas and hydrocarbon columns. A Contour Map is a specialised 2D view with many of the same features as the 3D views, including property filters, range filters and display of faults and wells.
Export of Contour Map Data To export a contour map, invoke one of the following options (c.f. figure above):
Select right-click command Export Contour Map to text in the graphics window showing a contour map. Select right-click command Export Contour Map to text for a contour map in the Project Tree This initiates the following dialog for export options:
As seen, the dialog facilitates the following options:
Setting the file name for export. Export of local coordinates, i.e. coordinates measured from local origo defined in lower, left corner of contour map. Default is export of full UTM coordinates. Defining a text label to exclude undefined values. Default label is NaN. Exclude undefined values based on the given label. Export file format The file format for export of contour maps supports use of Python and numpy. For instance, an exported file may can be imported into numpy using the loadtxt() function.
Metadata is included as comments in the beginning of the file. The character # as first character denotes a comment line.
If local coordinates are exported, the UTM coordinate offset is included as a comment in the header of the export file (c.f. example file below). To anonymize the data, the UTM coordinate offset may be removed from file.

ResInsight allows the user to create a ensemble RFT plot similar to summary ensemble plots. The functionality also computes statistics, e.g. P10, P90, and mean. When possible, ResInsight avoids loading the grid when reading ensemble RFT data.
Create New Ensemble RFT Plot When a summary ensemble has been imported, observed FMU data can be imported via right-clicking Observed Data in the Plot Project Tree, and selecting Import Observed FMU Data.
To create ensemble RFT plot, right-click RFT Plots and select New RFT Plot.
Property Editor The property editor lets the user select which curves to display in the RFT plot.
Well Name Select the well to display in the plot. Wells postfixed by &rsquo;(Well Path)&rsquo; have an associated well trajectory loaded.
Sources Subsequent to selecting a well in the Well Name field, the relevant sources for that well will appear in the Sources field. The sources for this particular case are:
Ensembles with RFT Data &ndash; List of ensembles which contain RFT data with check-boxes to activate display. Observed FMU data &ndash; Observed data imported from a FMU run. When the user selects one or more sources, a selection of their time steps appears in the Time Steps field.
Time Steps The Time Steps field contains the relevant time steps according to the source selection. Time steps are deemed to be relevant by the following rules:
If a single source or sources of the same type are selected, all available time steps in those sources are shown. If sources from two or tree types are selected, the time steps are filtered: The time steps matching the observed case(s) time steps. If no time steps from a case match the observed time step, the two adjacent ones are shown. The first time step from any grid case(s) (as initial pressure reference). If the Observed data isn&rsquo;t selected, the RFT data serves as filter reference. Each time step is postfixed by letter(s) to indicate source type(s) of each time step. The source types are indicated in square brackets:
O &ndash; Time step has Observed data E &ndash; Time step has Ensemble data R &ndash; Time step has RFT data G &ndash; Time step has Grid data More than one letter for one single time step, means that the time step comes from multiple case types.
Zonation/Formation Names The display of formations lines is controlled in the same manner as for RFT plots. Please see the full documentation of the formations property editor for details about formations.
Legend and Axis Visual properties of legend and axes is controlled in the same manner as for RFT plots.
Color by Ensemble Parameter One ensemble parameter is selected to control coloring. The ensemble parameter value for each case is used to pick a color in a color range. In this case a color legend appears.
Import of Observed Ensemble RFT data from FMU Observed RFT data as part of a FMU run is presupposed to be located in a folder which contains the following four file types:
layer_zone_table.txt &lt;well_name&gt;.obs &lt;well_name&gt;.txt well_date_rft.txt The purpose and format of the data files is explained below.
The data file well_date_rft.txt is required. If missing, no Observed FMU data will be imported.
Correlation of grid and formations The file layer_zone_table.txt can be used to correlate each grid k-layer with a formation name. This file is identical for all cases in the same ensemble.
Example file layer_zone_table.txt:

`,url:"/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/workflows/"},window.store["/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/calculated-data/derivedresults/"]={title:"Derived Results - Eclipse",content:`ResInsight computes several derived results. In this section we will explain what they are, and briefly how they are calculated.
Derived Results for Eclipse Cases ResInsight calculates several derived cell properties that is made available as Static or Dynamic cell properties. The derived results listed at the bottom of the Static result properties, are shown below.
Transmissibility Normalized by Area The transmissibility for cells and Non-Neighbor Connections (NNCs) are dependent on both cell properties and geometry. ResInsight normalizes TRANX, TRANY and TRANZ with the overlapping flow area for both neighbor cells and NNC-cells. The results are named riTRANXbyArea, riTRANYbyArea and riTRANZbyArea respectively.
The normalized transmissibilities make it easier to compare and check the flow capacity visually. This can be useful when history matching pressure differences across a fault.
Overall Transmissibility Multiplier Transmissibility can be set or adjusted with multiple keywords in an Eclipse data deck. To visualize the adjustments made, ResInsight calculates a multiplicator for the overall change. First unadjusted transmissibilities for all neighbor cells and NNCs are evaluated based on geometry and permeabilities, similar to the NEWTRAN algorithm in Eclipse. For x- and y-directions, the NTG parameter is also included. The results are named riTRANX, riTRANY and riTRANZ respectively.
The TRANX, TRANY and TRANZ used in the simulation are divided by the ResInsight calculated transmissibilities and the resulting multiplicators are named riMULTX, riMULTY and riMULTZ respectively. The derived properties are listed under Static properties. The riMULT-properties are useful for quality checking consistence in user input for fault seal along a fault plane.
Classification of Cells having NNCs The static result riNncCells use 1 to represent cells having a NNC and 0 for other cells.
Directional Combined Results Cell properties with names ending in I, J, K, X, Y, or Z, and an optional &ldquo;+&rdquo; or &ldquo;-&rdquo; are combined into derived results post-fixed with IJK, or XYZ depending on their origin. (Eg. the static cell properties MULTX, MULTY, MULTZ, and their negatives are combined into the result MULTXYZ, while the dynamic cell properties FLRGASI, FLRGASJ, FLRGASK are combined to FLRGASIJK).
These combined cell properties visualize the property as a color in all directions combined when selected in as a Cell Result and Separate Fault Result.
The face of a cell is then colored based on the value associated with that particular face. The Positive I-face of the cell gets the cell X/I-value, while the J-face gets the Y/J-value etc. The negative faces, however, get the value from the neighbor cell on that side. The negative I-face gets the X-value of the IJK-neighbor in negative I direction, and so on for the J- and K-faces.
The directional combined parameters available are:
Static Properties TRANXYZ (inluding NNCs) MULTXYZ riTRANXYZ (inluding NNCs) riMULTXYZ (inluding NNCs) riTRANXYZbyArea (inluding NNCs) Dynamic Properties FLRWATIJK (inluding NNCs) FLROILIJK (inluding NNCs) FLRGASIJK (inluding NNCs) Generated Octave generated results with same name but ending with I,J and K will also be combined into a &lt;name&gt;IJK cell property. Completion Type The dynamic cell property named Completion Type is calculated from the intersections between Completions and the grid cells. All grid cells intersected by a completion will be assigned a color based on the type of completion that intersects the cell.
If a cell is completed with multiple completions, the following priority is used : Fracture, Fishbones, and Perforation Interval.
Identification of Questionable NNCs In the process of normalizing transmissibility by the overlapping flow area, the NNCs in the model without any shared surface between two cells are identified. These NNCs are listed in the Faults/NNCs With No Common Area folder. These NNCs are questionable since flow normally is associated with a flow area.
Water Flooded PV Water Flooded PV, also called Number of flooded porevolumes shows the amount of flow from a selected set of simulation tracers into a particular cell, compared to the cells mobile pore volume. A value of 1.0 will tell that the tracers accumulated flow into the cell has reached a volume equal to the mobile pore volume in the cell.
Mobile Pore Volume Mobile Pore Volume MOBPORV is computed based on the grid cell properties PORV, SWCR and MULTPV.
If MULTPV is missing, MULTPV is set to 1.0. If SWCR is missing, SWCR is et to 0.0.
$ MOBPORV = MULTPV * PORV * (1.0 - SWCR) $

A PLT (Production Log Tool) plot is a special well plot for comparing observed production (well flow rates) and simulated production. The curves are plotted as production against measured depth (MD). Simulated production data is retrieved directly from the grid model or from the corresponding (*.rft) files, while observed production data are loaded from well log files (*.las).
Create New PLT Plot There are several ways to create new PLT Plots
From Project Tree in the Plot Main Window
Select right-click command New PLT Plot for the PLT Plots node. From the Project Tree in the Main Window
Select right-click command New PLT Plot for a Well Path node or a Simulation Well node that has an associated well path. From the 3D view
Right-click a well path, or a simulation well that has an associated well path, and select Well Plots -&gt; New PLT Plot. Plot Observed Data To be able to plot observed production data for a well, a well log file containing that data must be imported. Production data in a well log file is expected to have column names:
Component Names Oil QOZT, QOIL, xxxx_QOIL Gas QOZT, QGAS, xxxx_QGAS Water QGZT, QWAT, xxxx_QWAT Total QTZT, QTOT, xxxx_QTOT To be able to plot simulated data for a well, the trajectory for that well have to be imported. If no well trajectory is found, ResInsight will present a warning dialog to the user.
Property Editor The property editor lets the user select which curves to display in the PLT plot.
Well Name Select the well to display in the plot. Only observed well paths are displayed.
Sources After a well has been selected in the Well Name field, sources for that well should appear in the sources field. The sources are placed in one of three different groups:
RFT File Cases &ndash; Simulation cases may have associated PLT data in *.rft file(s). If the simulation case contains such files, those are imported together with the simulation case (See the keyword WRFTPLT in the Eclipse manual for information) Grid Cases &ndash; Simulation cases Observed Cases &ndash; Observed data imported from well log files and well path files When the user selects a source, time steps for that source appears in the Time Steps field.
Time Steps The Time Steps field contains available time steps for the selected source(s). Some combinations of selected sources may display a filtered list of time steps instead of the union of all time steps for all selected sources. The policy is as follows:
Exclusively grid cases selected. All available time steps for the selected grid cases are displayed. Grid case(s) and observed data case selected. Time steps shown are: The first time step from the merged time step list from all grid cases. If no time steps from grid cases match the observed time step, display the two adjacent grid case time steps. Grid case(s) and RFT File case(s) selected. Same display logic as point 2. All types of cases selected. Same display logic as point 2 with the exception that RFT File case time steps are treated as grid time steps. Each time step is postfixed by an indication of which source type(s) the time step is belonging to. This indication is displayed as one or more letters within square brackets. Examples: [ O ], [ R G ].
O &ndash; Time step belongs to observed data R &ndash; Time step belongs to RFT data G &ndash; Time step belongs to Grid data More than one letter for one single time step, means that the time step belongs to multiple case types.
Curve Selection The curve selection group lets the user control which component(s) of the PLT data to display.
Standard Volume &ndash; Production data at standard conditions (normal air pressure) Reservoir Volume &ndash; Production data at reservoir pressure (high air pressure) Oil &ndash; The oil production component Gas &ndash; The gas production component Water &ndash; The water production component Total &ndash; Total production Zonation/Formation Names This property editor lets the user control how formations are handled. This is what it looks like in the PLT plot context.
Please see the full documentation on the formations property editor for details.
When the formation names property editor is used in the context of PLT plots, the fields Trajectory and Simulation Well are hidden because those values are given by the PLT plot definition.
Legend and Axis This property editor lets the user control visual properties for the legend and axis.

A Vertical Flow Performance Plot (VFP Plot) shows the relationship between bottom hole well conditions and wellhead pressure describing a well&rsquo;s ability to lift fluids to the surface. ResInsight can display both production and injection VFP plots.
Creating VFP Plots VFP Plots are created by right-clicking the VFP Plots item in Plot Project Tree.
Production VFP Plot The production VFP Plot shows the outflow or downstream pressure based on the inlet or upstream pressure and the phases flowing through the system. For a well this means the table relates the flowing bottom-hole pressure (BHP) to the well&rsquo;s tubing head pressure (THP) based on the oil, gas and water rates (and any artificial lift quantities like gas lift gas), or phases ratios, flowing up the wellbore. The data is read from files containing the VFPPROD Eclipse keyword.
The following is an example of a production VFP Plot and corresponding Property Editor.
The available settings of the production Property Editor are:
File Path: The VFP data file(s) to plot. Multi-selection of files is possible.
Table Number: The table number, i.e. VFPTAB keyword in Eclipse data.
Reference Depth: The reference depth used to generate the table, i.e. VFPREF keyword in Eclipse data.
Interpolated Variable: Y-axis variable.
Flowing Phase: The flowing phase in the system, i.e. FLO keyword in Eclipse data.
Flowing Water Fraction: Corresponds to the WFR keyword in Eclipse data.
Flowing Gas Fraction: Corresponds to the GFR keyword in Eclipse data.
Primary Variable: Variable on X-axis.
Family Variable: Variable for grouping of properties.
Fixed Variables: Used to choose which table to display.
Plot data can be exported by right-clicking the actual plot and selecting Show Plot Data.
Injection VFP Plot The Injection VFP Plot shows the outflow or downstream pressure based on the inlet or upstream pressure and the phases being injected into the system. For a well this means the table relates the flowing bottom-hole pressure (BHP) to the well&rsquo;s tubing head pressure (THP) based on the oil, gas or water injection rates. The data can be read from files containing the VFPINJ Eclipse keyword.

The Biot porelastic coefficient ($\\alpha$) defines the compressibility of sand grains: $\\alpha = 1.0$ for incompressible grains, and $\\alpha &lt; 1.0$ for compressible grains. $\\alpha$ is not used for the initial (Geostatic) time step. The default value is 1.0, but values per element can be imported as an element property table.\nThe bulk modulus for solid material is defined as:\n$ K_s = \\frac{ K_{fr} }{ 1 - \\alpha}, K_{fr} = \\frac{ E }{ 3(1-2\\nu)} $\nWhere:\n$ E $ is the elastic modulus (Young&rsquo;s modulus) from element property table MODULUS. $ \\nu $ is Poisson&rsquo;s ratio imported from element property table RATIO. Vertical Compressibility $ C_{v} = - \\frac{ \\Delta\\epsilon_{\\nu}}{ \\alpha \\Delta P_p } $\n$ \\Delta\\epsilon_\\nu $ is the vertical strain change between current state and reference state (E33 in ResInsight).\nVertical Compressibility Ratio $ C_{vr} = \\frac{ C_v E(1-\\nu) } { (1+\\nu) ( 1 - 2\\nu) } $\nVertical Compression Ratio is the ratio between the real vertical compression and the compression in a uniaxial strain case. All parameters are described above.\nPorosity and Permeability Porosity Porosity change is defined as either total change in porosity between initial (geostatic) state and current state, or change in porosity between a reference state and the current state $ \\Delta\\phi $. The latter is given as\n$ \\Delta\\phi = \\phi_0(C_p \\Delta P_p + \\Delta\\epsilon_{vol}) $\nHere, $\\Delta\\phi_0$ is found from this equation with the reference state being the initial state (geostatic). The current porosity is then given as\n$ \\phi = \\phi_0 + \\Delta\\phi_0 $\nwith $ \\phi_0 $ being the porosity at the initial state, $\\Delta\\phi_0$ is porosity change between initial (geostatic) state current, $C_p$ is pore compressibility (between reference and current state), $\\Delta P_p$ is change in pore pressure and $\\Delta\\epsilon_{vol}$ is volumetric strain change.\nInitial Porosity Porosity at the initial state:\n$ \\phi_0 = \\frac{VOIDR} {1 + VOIDR} $\nWhere:\nVOIDR is void ratio from Abaqus. Permeability An expression for permeability is taken from Petunin (2011).\n$ k = k_0( \\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_0} )^A $\nWhere:\n$k_0$ is the permeability at the initial state (unit: mD), $\\phi$ is porosity at current state, $\\phi_0$ is initial porosity, $A$ is a constant Mud Weight Window Mud Weight Window (MWW) represents the difference between the minimum and the maximum possible mud weight between specific formation layers representing top and base of a fictitious well section.\nTo find MWW a two step procedure is needed:\nfirst find the limits per element, determine the MWW for each element based on the vertical column. Finding Upper and Lower Mud Weight Limit The upper mud weight limit (UMWL) and lower mud weight limit (LMWL) is found for each element intersected by the fictitious well. The UMWL is either the fracture gradient (FG) or minimum horizontal stress (SHmin) for both sand and shale. The LMWL is defined as the maximum of shear fracture gradient (SFG) and/or pore pressure in shale, and as pore pressure in sand.\nThe calculations for fracture gradient and shear fracture gradient, and the needed input, are described in detail in Well Bore Stability Plots.\nMud Weight Window Thereafter, the combined use of mud weight limits for all elements between the top and base (for a given IJ) determines the MWW parameters as will be further described below.\nA reference element index ($K_{ref}$) represents the base or the top of the fictitious well. Then for a set of elements with i = I, j = J and k = K to $K_{ref}$ the maximum LWML and the minimum UWML must be found from these element values. Then the difference between the two defines the MWW parameter.\nThus for a vertical stack of elements $element_{ijk} = K \\to K_{ref}$, $MWW_{ijk}$ is given as\n$ MWW_{ijk} = maximum(LMWL) - minimum(UMWL) (k = K \\to K_{ref}) $\nSimilar calculations are made below the reference layer, but then with the reference layer as the top layer.\nIn addition to the MWW parameter, the mud weight representing the middle of the drilling window (MWM) is calculated if MWW &gt; 0. Otherwise, MWM should is undefined.\n",html:`<p>ResInsight computes several derived results. In this section we will explain what they are, and briefly how they are calculated.</p>

<h4 id="pore-compressibility-1">Pore Compressibility</h4>
<p>Pore compressibility between a reference state and the current stress state is defined as:</p>
<p>$ C_{p} = -\\frac{ \\alpha \\Delta\\epsilon_{vol}}{ \\Delta P_p \\phi_0} + \\frac{1}{K_s} ( \\frac{ \\alpha } { \\phi_0 } - 1) $</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ \\alpha $ is the Biot coefficient,</li>
<li>$ \\Delta\\epsilon_{vol} $ is volumetric strain change (EV in ResInsight) between curret state and reference state,</li>
<li>$ \\phi_0 $ is porosity on the Geostatic step,</li>
<li>$ \\Delta P_p $ is change in pore pressure between current state and reference state,</li>
<li>$ K_s $ bulk modulus for the solid material (grain).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Biot porelastic coefficient ($\\alpha$) defines the compressibility of sand grains: $\\alpha = 1.0$ for incompressible grains,
and $\\alpha &lt; 1.0$ for compressible grains. $\\alpha$ is not used for the initial (Geostatic) time step. The default value is 1.0, but values
per element can be imported as an <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/import/elementpropertytable/">element property table</a>.</p>
<p>The bulk modulus for solid material is defined as:</p>
<p>$ K_s = \\frac{ K_{fr} }{ 1 - \\alpha}, K_{fr} = \\frac{ E }{ 3(1-2\\nu)} $</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>

<p>$ \\Delta\\epsilon_\\nu $ is the vertical strain change between current state and reference state (E33 in ResInsight).</p>
<h4 id="vertical-compressibility-ratio">Vertical Compressibility Ratio</h4>
<p>$ C_{vr} = \\frac{ C_v E(1-\\nu) } { (1+\\nu) ( 1 - 2\\nu) } $</p>
<p>Vertical Compression Ratio is the ratio between the real vertical compression and the compression in a uniaxial strain case.
All parameters are described above.</p>
<h3 id="porosity-and-permeability">Porosity and Permeability</h3>
<h4 id="porosity">Porosity</h4>
<p>Porosity change is defined as either total change in porosity between initial (geostatic) state and current state,
or change in porosity between a reference state and the current state $ \\Delta\\phi $. The latter is given as</p>
<p>$ \\Delta\\phi = \\phi_0(C_p \\Delta P_p + \\Delta\\epsilon_{vol}) $</p>
<p>Here, $\\Delta\\phi_0$ is found from this equation with the reference state being the initial state (geostatic).
The current porosity is then given as</p>
<p>$ \\phi = \\phi_0 + \\Delta\\phi_0 $</p>
<p>with $ \\phi_0 $ being the porosity at the initial state, $\\Delta\\phi_0$ is porosity change between initial (geostatic)
state current, $C_p$ is pore compressibility (between reference and current state), $\\Delta P_p$ is change in pore pressure
and $\\Delta\\epsilon_{vol}$ is volumetric strain change.</p>
<h4 id="initial-porosity">Initial Porosity</h4>
<p>Porosity at the initial state:</p>

<ul>
<li>$k_0$ is the permeability at the initial state (unit: mD),</li>
<li>$\\phi$ is porosity at current state,</li>
<li>$\\phi_0$ is initial porosity,</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="mud-weight-window">Mud Weight Window</h3>
<p>Mud Weight Window (MWW) represents the difference between the minimum and the maximum possible
mud weight between specific formation layers representing top and base of a fictitious well section.</p>
<p>To find MWW a two step procedure is needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>first find the limits per element,</li>
<li>determine the MWW for each element based on the vertical column.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="finding-upper-and-lower-mud-weight-limit">Finding Upper and Lower Mud Weight Limit</h4>
<p>The upper mud weight limit (UMWL) and lower mud weight limit (LMWL) is found for each element intersected by the fictitious well.
The UMWL is either the fracture gradient (FG) or minimum horizontal stress (SHmin) for both sand and shale.
The LMWL is defined as the maximum of shear fracture gradient (SFG) and/or pore pressure in shale, and as pore pressure in sand.</p>
<p>The calculations for fracture gradient and shear fracture gradient, and the needed input, are described in detail
in <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/plot-window/wellborestabilityplots/">Well Bore Stability Plots</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mud-weight-window-1">Mud Weight Window</h4>
<p>Thereafter, the combined use of mud weight limits for all elements between the top and base (for a given IJ)
determines the MWW parameters as will be further described below.</p>
<p>A reference element index ($K_{ref}$) represents the base or the top of the fictitious well. Then for a set
of elements with i = I, j = J and k = K to $K_{ref}$ the maximum LWML and the minimum UWML must be found from
these element values. Then the difference between the two defines the MWW parameter.</p>
<p>Thus for a vertical stack of elements $element_{ijk} = K \\to K_{ref}$, $MWW_{ijk}$ is given as</p>
<p>$ MWW_{ijk} = maximum(LMWL) - minimum(UMWL) (k = K \\to K_{ref}) $</p>
<p>Similar calculations are made below the reference layer, but then with the reference layer as the top layer.</p>
<p>In addition to the MWW parameter, the mud weight representing the middle of the drilling window (MWM) is calculated if MWW &gt; 0.
Otherwise, MWM should is undefined.</p>

Flow Diagnostics Plots can be used to view well allocation, well inflow rates, cumulative saturation along time of flight and flow characteristics.
They are managed from the folder Flow Diagnostics Plots located in Plot Project Tree in the Plot Main Window.
This folder contains a default Flow Characteristics Plot and Well Allocation Plot. In addition, two folders with stored well allocation and flow characteristics plots will show up if there are any of those in the model.
Please refer to Cell Results-&gt; Flow Diagnostic Results for a description of the results and references to more information about the methodology.
Well Allocation Plots Well allocation plots show the flow along a specified well, along with either phase distribution or the amount of support from/to other wells. The total phase or allocation is shown in the legend and as a pie chart, while the well flow is shown in a depth value vs flow graph.
In addition a Cumulative Saturation by Time of Flight plot may be shown. This little plot illustrates how the total saturation changes as you go from the well-connection-cells along increasing time of flight adding the cells as you go.
Branches Each branch of the well will be assigned a separate Track. For normal wells this is based on the branch detection algorithm used for Well Pipe visualization, and will correspond to the pipe visualization with Branch Detection On ( See Well Pipe Geometry ). Multi Segment Wells will be displayed according to their branch information, but tiny branches consisting of only one connection are lumped into the main branch to make the visualization more understandable ( See Dummy branches ).
Creating Well Allocation Plots To plot the Well allocation for a well, right-click the well in the Project Tree or in the 3D View and invoke the command Plot Well Allocation.
The command updates the default Well Allocation Plot with new values based on the selection and the settings in the active view. This plot can then be copied to the Stored Plots folder by the right-click command Add Stored Well Allocation Plot.
Options The Legend, Total Allocation pie chart, Cumulative Saturation, and the Well Flow/Allocation can be turned on or off from the toggles in the Project Tree. The other options are controlled from the property panel of a Well Allocation Plot:
Name &ndash; Auto generated name used as plot title Show Plot Title &ndash; Toggles whether to show the title in the plot Plot Data &ndash; Options controlling when and what the plot is based on Case &ndash; The case to plot data from Time Step &ndash; The selected time step Well &ndash; The simulation well to plot Options Plot Type Allocation &ndash; Plots Reservoir well flow rates along with how this well supports/are supported by other wells ( This option is only available for cases with Flux results available ) Well Flow &ndash; Plots Surface Well Flow Rates together with phase split between Oil, Gas, and Water Flow Type Accumulated &ndash; Plots an approximation of the accumulated flow along the well Inflow Rates &ndash; Plots the rate of flow from the connection into the well Group Small Contributions &ndash; Groups small well contributions into a group called Other Threshold &ndash; Threshold used by the Group Small Contributions option Depth Settings The depth value in the plot can be controlled by selecting the Accumulated Flow/Inflow Rates item in the Project Tree. This item represents the Well-Log-like part of the Well Allocation Plot and its properties are shown below:
Name &ndash; The plot name, updated automatically based on the Flow Type and well. Depth Type Pseudo Length &ndash; Use the length along the visualized simulation well pipe as depth. In this mode the curves are extended somewhat above zero depth keeping the curve values constant. This is done to make it easier to see the final values of the curves relative to each other.
The depth are calculated with Branch detection On and using the Interpolated well pipe geometry.
( See Well Pipe Geometry ) TVD &ndash; Use True Vertical Depth on the depth-axis. This will produce distorted plots for horizontal or near horizontal wells. Connection Number &ndash; Use the number of connections counted from the top on the depth-axis. Visible Depth Range &ndash; These options control the depth zoom. Auto Scale &ndash; Toggles autoscale on/off. The plot is autoscaled when significant changes to its settings are made. Min, Max &ndash; Sets the visible depth range. These are updated when zooming using the mouse wheel etc. Accessing the Plot Data The command right-click command Show Plot Data will show a window containing the plot data in ascii format. The content of this window is easy to copy and paste into Excel or other tools for further processing.
It is also possible to save the ascii data to a file directly by using the right-click command Export Plot Data to Text File on the Accumulated Flow/Inflow Rates item in the Project Tree.
The total accumulation data can also be viewed in ascci format by the command Show Total Allocation Data.
Producer/Injector Connectivity Table Use Producer/Injector Connectivity Table to see the flow diagnostics communication between producer and injector wells for selected time steps.
Well Allocation Over Time Use Well Allocation Over Time to see the allocation over multiple restart time steps.
Cumulative Phase Distribution Plot A Cumulative Phase Distribution Plot shows the volumetric oil, gas, and water distribution from contributing wells to a target well. For producer B-2H, for instance, such a plot can be created by right-clicking its entry under Simulation Wells in Project Tree.
A Cumulative Phase Distribution Plot can also be created by right-clicking a Cumulative Saturation plot, c.f. figure below.
Clicking its entry in Plot Project Tree, displays content and settings of the Cumulative Phase Distribution Plot.
Flow Characteristics Plot This window displays three different graphs describing the overall behavior of the reservoir for each time step from a flow diagnostics point of view.
Lorenz Coefficient &ndash; This plot displays the Lorenz coefficient for the complete reservoir for each selected time step. The time step color is used as a reference for the time step in the other graphs. Flow Capacity vs Storage Capacity &ndash; This plot displays one curve for each time step of the F-phi curve for the reservoir. Sweep Efficiency &ndash; This plot displays one Sweep Efficiency curve for each selected time step. Settings Case &ndash; Selects the source case for the plot. Time Steps &ndash; These options selects the time steps to be used in the plot. All With Calculated FlowDiagnostics &ndash; Plot data from all the time steps already solved by the Flow Diagnostics Solver, but nothing more. The solver will be run implicitly when the user requests any Flow Diagnostics results on a particular time step using Cell Results, Well Allocation Plots, or Well Log Extraction Curves. Selected &ndash; Use the selected time steps only. Activating this options displays a listbox with all the available time steps in the 3D case. Time steps already solved by the Flow Diagnostics Solver are marked with an asterix *. Select the interesting time steps and press apply to invoke the solver for unsolved time steps, and to show them in the plot. Region &ndash; These group of options controls the cell region of interest for the plot. Cell Filter &ndash; Selects the type of cell filtering to apply. Sub-options are displayed depending on the selection. All Active Cells &ndash; Use all the active cells in the model (default) Visible Cells &ndash; Use the visible cells in a particular predefined view as cell region. This option will respect all the filter settings in the view, and use the correct cell set for each time step. View &ndash; The view to use as cell filter Injector Producer Communication &ndash; The region of communication between selected producers and injectors. See Flow Diagnostic Results Tracer Filter &ndash; Wild card based filter-text to filter the list of tracers list &ndash; Producer and injector tracers to select Show Region &ndash; Button to create (or edit) a 3D View showing the selected region of cells. Min communication &ndash; A threshold for the cells communication value. Cells with communication below this threshold is omitted from the region.

<p>This folder contains a default <strong>Flow Characteristics Plot</strong> and <strong>Well Allocation Plot</strong>. In addition, two folders with stored  well allocation and flow characteristics plots will show up if there are any of those in the model.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/3d-main-window/cellresults/#flow-diagnostic-results">Cell Results-&gt; Flow Diagnostic Results</a> for a description of the results and references to more information about the methodology.</p>
<h2 id="well-allocation-plots">Well Allocation Plots</h2>
<p>Well allocation plots show the flow along a specified well, along with either phase distribution or the amount of support from/to other wells. The total phase or allocation is shown in the legend and as a pie chart, while the well flow is shown in a depth value vs flow graph.</p>
<p>In addition a <strong>Cumulative Saturation by Time of Flight</strong> plot may be shown. This little plot illustrates how the total saturation changes as you go from the well-connection-cells along increasing time of flight adding the cells as you go.</p>
<h3 id="branches">Branches</h3>
<p>Each branch of the well will be assigned a separate <strong>Track</strong>. For normal wells this is based on the branch detection algorithm used for Well Pipe visualization, and will correspond to the pipe visualization with <strong>Branch Detection</strong> <em>On</em> ( See <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/wells-and-completions/simulationwells/#well-pipe-geometry">Well Pipe Geometry</a> ).
Multi Segment Wells will be displayed according to their branch information, but tiny branches consisting of only one connection are lumped into the main branch to make the visualization more understandable ( See  <a href="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/wells-and-completions/simulationwells/#dummy-branches">Dummy branches</a> ).</p>
<h3 id="creating-well-allocation-plots">Creating Well Allocation Plots</h3>
<p>To plot the Well allocation for a well, right-click the well in the <strong>Project Tree</strong> or in the <strong>3D View</strong> and invoke the command <strong>Plot Well Allocation</strong>.</p>

Producer/Injector Connectivity Tables is a display of Flow Diagnostics Data as a color map in table format. The table either shows flow rate data for a single time step, or accumulated flow volume data over a range of time steps.
The table lists one producer per row and one injector per column. The cell data is the flow rate data or accumulated flow volume data based on the selected Time Step Type. This table data provides an overview of the communicating wells in the reservoir, and shows which injector contributes to which producer, and who are the largest contributors to production.
The table can be formatted by use of the Property Editor, shown below. The cell data type is controlled by Value Type and the rows/columns can be filtered by selectecting producers and injectors in the Tracer Selection. Columns are controlled by the selection of resampling, and rows are controlled by selected Threshold value and Exclude Rows.
Creating Producer/Injector Connectivity Tables The Producer/Injector Connectivity Tables are a part of the Flow Diagnostics Plots. Click here for how to generate the plots from 3D view.
Editing Table The settings for the Producer/Injector Connectivity Table is listed in the Property Editor.
The main controls for a Producer/Injector Connectivity Table is listed below:
Plot Data The plot data can be configured, and controls are depending on selections in Filter by 3D View.
Filter by 3D View - Utilize the active filters in 3D view (see Filter) to collect which wells are present in the visible cells. Time Step Type - Select between single time step or a range of time steps. Single Time Step - Shows flow rate - as raw value, fraction or percentage. Time Step Range - Shows accumulated flow volume - as raw value, fraction or percentage. Threshold - Set threshold value for injectors. Exclude columns (injectors) if no row in column has value above threshold. With filtering Disabled: Select Wells For Time Step(s) - Automatically select producer and injector wells present for selected time step(s): With filtering Enabled: Filter type - Select how to apply the 3D view filtering to the table data. Filter Producers - Select producer wells visible in selected Filter by 3D view, and synch communicating injectors. Filter Injectors - Select injector wells visible in selected Filter by 3D view, and synch communicating producers. Calculate By Visible Cells - Provide the cell filter to the calculation of well flow, and produce flow rate and accumulated flow volume data only using the cells present in the visible cells of 3D view. Flow Diagnostics Configuration The content of flow diagnostics configuration is dependent on the selected Time Step Type.
Value Type - Select which value type to fill in table cells Single Time Step - Select between Flow Rate, Flow Rate Fraction and Flow Rate Percentage Time Step Range - Select between Accumulate Flow Volume, Accumulate Flow Volume Fraction and Accumulate Flow Volume Percentage Single Time Step: Value Type - Select which value type to fill in table cells: Flow Rate, Flow Rate Fraction and Flow Rate Percentage. Time Step - Select which time step to get data from Time Step Range: Value Type - Select which value type to fill in table cells: Accumulate Flow Volume, Accumulate Flow Volume Fraction and Accumulate Flow Volume Percentage From Time Step - Select time step to start range from. To Time Step - Select time step to end range on. Filter - Filter number of time steps to include: Show All Time Steps or Time Step Count. Number of Time Steps - Set number of time steps to include between From and To selection. Exclude Time Steps - Exclude specific time step if wanted. Tracer Selection Select which Producers and Injectors to include in the table. If no wells are selected, no filtering is active - thereby all producers and injectors present among the selected time steps are visible in the table when values are above threshold.
An example of applying a Slice Filter in Filter by 3D View and select Filter Type: Filter Producers, produces the following Tracer Selection and table view:
Note: If a selected well does not exist among the selected time steps, it will not be present in the table.

Grid Case Group&rsquo;s are designed to make it easy to calculate statistics per cell and per time step of a large number of Eclipse simulation Cases with identical Grids (often labeled realizations).
If you have several Eclipse simulations with different input parameters available, you can put all the realizations into a Grid Case Group and easily calculate each of the cells mean value, range and max/min values at each time step. Grid calculations can optionally be used as a data source for computations.
Creating Grid Case Groups From Files The easiest way to create a Grid Case Group is to use the Import command: File-&gt;Import-&gt;Eclipse Cases-&gt;Create Grid Case Group
This command will display the recursive file import dialog described on the Summary Plots page.
ResInsight then creates a Grid Case Group for you, and populates its Source Cases with the Cases you selected. Then the first of those Cases are read completely, while the others are just scanned to verify that the Grids match and to detect changes in the Active Cells layout. This makes it quite fast to load even a quite large number of realizations.
Manually A Grid Case Group can be created from the right-click menu of a Result Case, Input Case or a different Grid Case Group. Source Cases can then be added by using the mouse to drag and drop cases with equal grids into the Grid Case Group&rsquo;s Source Case folder. This is useful if you want to create statistics based only on a subset of the source cases in an already created Grid Case Group.
Drag and Drop of cases will normally copy the cases to the new destination, but moving them is possible by pressing and holding the Shift key while dropping.
Viewing Special Source Cases To reduce the number of views, only a view for the first case is created automatically. If you want to inspect the results of a particular source case, select New view from the right-click menu. A new 3D View will the be created on that particular case.
How to limit system resource allocation To reduce memory usage, project loading time etc. remember to delete the 3D Views you do not need. 3D Views uses a lot of system resources. Statistics After creating a grid case group, an empty Statistics Case is created for you in the Derived Statistics folder of the Grid Case Group.
Setting Up and Calculate Settings for grid case property statistics
Compute &ndash; Starts to calculate requested statistical Properties. Edit &ndash; Deletes the calculated results, and makes the controls to edit the setup available. Summary of calculation setup &ndash; Summarizes what to calculate. Properties to consider &ndash; These options makes it possible to select what Eclipse properties to include in the Statistical calculations. Adding variables increase the memory usage and the computational time. Percentile Setup &ndash; Selects whether to calculate percentiles, what method and what percentile levels should be used. Turning this off speeds up the calculations. Well Data Source Case &ndash; This option selects which set of Simulation Wells to be shown along with the statistical results. You can select one of the Source Cases. Settings for grid cell calculations
Data Source &ndash; Defines either a cell property or a grid calculation expression to be used as data source for the statistical calculations. Grid Calculation &ndash; List of all defined calculations in the project. Filter By View &ndash; Limit the calculation to visible cells in a selected view. Cell values in a selection of cells can be aggregated as described in Aggregation of Grid Cell Values
Settings for when statistics has been computed
Percentile Methods Three Percentile methods are implemented:
Interpolated Observation &ndash; The values are sorted, and the two observations representing the probabilities closest to the percentile are interpolated to find the value for the percentile. This is the default method. Nearest Observation &ndash; The values are sorted, and the first observation representing a probability higher or equal to the percentile probability is selected as the value for the percentile. This method is by some considered to be statistically more puristic. Histogram based estimate &ndash; A histogram is created and the percentile is calculated based on the histogram. This method will be faster when having a large number of realizations, because no value sorting is involved. You would however need several hundred realizations before this method should be considered. Viewing the Results When the computation is complete, you have to create a 3D View on the Statistics Case to view the results. Use the right-click menu of the Statistics Case to create it.
Adding Statistics Cases A new statistical calculation can be created by activating the right-click menu for Derived Statistic-&gt;New Statistics Case.

ResInsight supports the creation of scatter / cross plots of two Eclipse results against each other, with each cell in the grid representing one data point in the plot. The data points can be grouped by a third result, by time step or by Formations. giving a separate color and label for each group. The above example shows a classic Porosity vs Permeability plot, grouped by formations, showing different trends for each formation.
For continuous grouping parameters, the parameter will be divided into a set of equally sized intervals depending on the number of Color Legend intervals.
Each cross plot can contain any number of Data Sets, representing a collection of cross plot points, where the Data Set can have a case source, time step and cell filter associated with it. This way, dynamic parameters for different time steps can be compared, or results from different case realizations.
The Grid Cross plots may have a Symbol Legend below the plot, separating the Data Sets, and a Color Legend within the plot separating between the different Grouping categories or intervals. In addition, an Info Box will be added to the upper right corner of the plot, showing the different data sets in the plot and the parameters used. The Color Legends and Info Box can be moved to other parts of the plot and will snap to edges and corners when moved close to them.
Creating Grid Cross Plots Grid Cross Plots can be created in a couple of ways:
Select a 3D view or Cell Result in the main ResInsight window, right-click and select Create Grid Cross Plot from 3d View. The resulting cross plot will display the current 3d Result x DEPTH and only contain data points for the visible cells. Right-click on the Grid Cross Plots entry under Plots in the Plot Window. By default the plot will contain the result values PORO x PERMX and will be grouped by formations (if any are loaded in the project). Data for all active cells will be displayed. Having created a Grid Cross Plot, the appearance of the Legends, the Info box and the Plot Title can be set in the Property Editor of the Grid Cross Plot.
The plot also have some available settings for the two plot axes (X and Y), where the title position and font size can be altered plus the axis range may be controlled and the axis may be set as logarithmic and inverted so the smallest value is first (default for DEPTH on the Y-axis).
Regression Curves A regression curve can be displayed for each data group. The display of regression curves is controlled from the Regression Curves folder.
Grid Cross Plot Data Sets Further Grid Cross Plot data sets can be added to a Plot by right clicking on the plot in the Project Tree and selecting New Data Set.
The Data Sets contain all the parameters controlling the data source and types of data being plotted.
The available parameters are:
Parameter Description Case The Eclipse Case containing the data Time Step Show data for All Time Steps or just a specific time step Filter by 3d View Visibility Pick a view to use only the cells visible in that view. Allows the use of range and property filters Group Data by Group and color data points by Time Step, Result Property or Formations Data Grouping Property Available if grouping by Result Property and lets you pick any Eclipse result property and the number of intervals to divide the data into X-Axis Property The property representing the X-axis in the cross plot Y-Axis Property The property representing the Y-axis in the cross plot Name Configuration Add Case Name, Axis Variables, Time Step and/or Data Group to the name of the Data set Show Plot Data The data used to create the Cross Plot can be exported by either right-clicking on the Cross Plot in the project tree or right clicking on the plot itself and selecting Show Plot Data.
Either method will bring up a dialog containing column-based text showing the X and Y result values, the Group index and Group Description (the latter two if Grouping is enabled). One tab in the dialog will be added for each Data Set. The data can be copied to the clipboard or exported to file by right-clicking on the text area.
Swap Axes The X- and Y-axes can be swapped, both for invididual data sets, by choosing Swap Axis Properties from the right-click menu of the Grid Cross Plot Data Set, or for all data sets by right clicking on either the Cross Plot in the Project Tree or on the plot itself and selecting Swap Axis Properties for all Data Sets in Plot. The X- and Y-axis will swap place retaining the properties, such as Logarithmic or inverted axes.

ResInsight offers a Comparison View to compare two existing views in terms of grid geometry, results, intersections and more. The Comparison View allows comparison of information of different grids and different solutions on the same grid in a single view. This improves efficiency and simplifies the workflow when working with related but different models.
The figure above exemplifies a Comparison View for comparison of two different simulations models and results. The left hand side is used to display grid and results of an Eclipse simulation while the right hand side displays an ABAQUS grid and simulation results from geomechanical analysis.
A different way to use the Comparison View is to compare the same geometrical grid with different Cell Results. Thus two cell results can easily be seen together in the same view.
Creating a Comparison View A Comparison View can be created as follows:
In Project Tree, select a view and specify Comparison View in the Viewer section of Property Editor Right-click a 3D View, and select Compare To&hellip; Comparison View Divider In the figure below, the Comparison View is used to compare two different grids in the same view, one to the left and the other to the right of the divider between them. The screen aligned divider is possible to drag right and left by clicking the handle marked by a green circle.
View Properties and Settings Properties of an individual view included in a Comparison View are controlled by their respective settings, notably 3D Views, Cell Results, Result Color Legend, Cell Filters, and Intersections.
Setting up Linked Views may also be relevant, e.g. to syncronize cell results and cell filters.
Polyline Intersections does not facilitate picking points across the Comparison View divider. However, an intersection can be copied betweens views, see Intersections for details.

Flow Results lets the user investigate flow properties and fluxes in a reservoir, e.g. by flow vector visualizations selecting and combining different fluids and directions.
Flow Vectors Flow vectors are computed based on the Eclipse properties FLRGASI/J/K FLRWATI/J/K FLROILI/J/K. Visualization of flow vector results always use velocity instead of rate. Velocity is computed as flow rate divided by cell face area.
In order to show flow vectors, check the checkbox next to Flow Vector Result in Project Tree.
This updates the 3D View with arrows visualizing the fluxes for the given time step or animation. The directions, data source fluids, color, scale and threshold can be adjusted in the Property Editor.
The legend in 3D View maps the Flow Vector colors to their respective result values. By default it shows the max values for all time steps. The legend settings can be changed in the Color Legend sub item of the Flow Vector Result item in Project Tree.
When combining several fluids, the max value shown in legend is an aggregation of the single max values of each selected fluid. This means that this number might be higher than the result of any flow vector.
Flow Vector Settings The Property Editor controls the following settings:
Fluids: Selection of fluids for displaying fluxes as aggregated vectors in 3D view.
Visibility
&ndash; View Vectors: Select Per Face to show one flow vector per cell face or Cell Center Total to show only one vector per cell center (as an aggregation of all single direction vectors).
&ndash; Vectors Touching Surface: Select At Vector Anchor to display vectors starting at cell faces or At Vector Center to center vectors at cell faces. Vectors Touching Surface is enabled when View vectors is set to Per Face.
&ndash; I/J/K: Use flows in I/J/K direction for computing vectors.
&ndash; Show NNC data: Visualize flows between non-neighbouring cells.
&ndash; Threshold: All vectors with flow result values below this number are hidden.
Appearance: Select Result Colors to color vectors according to Element Vector Result legend in 3D View or Uniform for uniform color. Use Size Scale to scale vector length.
Cell Result View ResInsight may visualize intercell flows, flow rates, and transmissibilities as Cell Results optionally divided by face area, c.f. check-box Divide By Area below. For instance, the option enables comparison of horisontal and vertical flow velocities as alternative to flow rates as the latter is typically influenced by significant differences in cell face areas.
Specifically, the check-box Divide By Area is applicable to Eclipse properties FLROIL, FLRGAS, FLRWAT, FLOOIL, FLOGAS, FLOWAT, and transmissibilities TRAN and riTRAN. These results are listed in ResInsight postfixed by IJK+- or XYZ as shown above. As seen, checking Divide By Area is reflected by text /A in legend.

Streamlines lets the user investigate the flow of different phases through a reservoar. It allows for selecting both an individual phase or a combination of phases colored by the dominant phase or velocity. The visualization and animation of streamlines requires the Eclipse properties FLRGASI/J/K FLRWATI/J/K FLROILI/J/K.
Displaying Streamlines To display streamlines, select a time step and check the Streamlines checkbox in Project Tree.
Property Editor The display and animation of streamlines is controlled by the Property Editor.
The following groups of settings control the content, display and animation of streamlines:
Data Selection
Phase: Selection of an individual phase (Oil, Gas, Water) or Combined display. Flow Threshold: Minimum flow threshold calculated as I/J/K flow rate divided by corresponding face area. Minimum Length: Minimum length of streamlines in meters. Resolution: Resolution of streamline animation in days (governing the number of individual animation steps). Max Days: Maximum calculation range in days for streamline animation. Well Selection
Injector Wells: Calculate streamlines stemming from injector wells. Producer Wells: Calculate streamlines backtracing from producer wells. Visualization Settings
Visualization Mode: Perform an animation of streamlines or manually control the display. Colors: Color the streamlines by dominant phase or by velocity. Animation Speed: Adjust the speed of streamline animation. Tracer Length: Adjust the length of the individual tracers pertinent to a streamline. In case Visualization Mode is set to Manual control, the setting Animation Index replaces the two latter settings. Animation Index allows for displaying an individual animation step.
Algorithm in brief Streamlines are generated by starting in open injector well cells and tracing out through the face with the largest flow rate (in m/day) into the next cell and so on. If flow rates above the given threshold exists for multiple cell faces, additional trace branches are spawned off for those faces. The distance between each point added to a trace is controlled by the resolution, as $ distance = rate * resolution $. The trace ends when either:
the flow goes below the user specified threshold the maximum number of days since the start of the trace have been reached a cell that already has a trace in it is encountered an active well cell is encountered Streamlines could also be generated using production wells as starting cells. In that case, the flow is reversed and the flow is traced backwards from the starting well using the same algorithm as for injector wells. Once reaching the end, the trace is reversed again to have the flow go into the production well in the final streamline.

Text annotations Reach circle annotations Polyline annotations User defined polylines Polylines imported from file Global scope vs local scope annotations Global annotations may be displayed in all views and are located in the Annotations project tree node right below Grid Models (Global annotations sub tree). Local annotations are associated with a specific view and are located in the Annotations project tree node below the view node (Local annotations sub tree). All annotation types except text annotations are global only. Text annotation may be either global or local.
All global annotations also have a representation in the local Annotation tree node in order to toggle visibilty per view. Those annotations are located in tree nodes starting with Global.
Local annotations sub tree
Global annotations sub tree
Text Annotations There are two ways of creating a new text annotation.
Right click Annotations or Text Annotations tree node in either the global annotatyion sub tree or the local annotations sub tree. The scope of the annotation depends on which node was clicked. When text annotations are created this way, all text annotation fields must be entered manunally in the property editor. Right click on an object in the view and select Create Text Annotation. ResInsight will then create a text annotation at the clicked point. In this case, only th text must be entered manually in the property editor. When creating a text annotation this way, it will become a local annotation by default. Anchor Point - The interesting point in the view Label Point - The point where the text label is placed Text - The text to display. Multiline supprted. The first line will be the name of the annotation in the project tree Text appearance - Set font size, font color, background color and anchor line color When a text annotation tree node is selected, target markers in each end of the anchor line are displayed. The targets can be clicked and dragged. Clicking the blue part lets the user drag the target vertically (along Z axis). Clicking the magenta part lets the user drag the target in the XY plane.
Reach Circle Annotations To create a reach circle annotation, right click Annotations or Reach Circle Annotations tree node in the global annotations sub tree. Then enter values in the property editor.
Name - Name of the circle annotation Center Point - Center point of the circle. Format &lsquo;x-pos y-pos depth&rsquo; Radius - Circle radius Line Appearance - Set circle color and line thickness User Defined Polyline Annotations To create a user defined polyline annotation, right click Annotations or User Defined Polyline Annotations tree node in the global annotations sub tree. The property editor for the newly created annotation is displayed and is in picking points mode. The user may now click on objects in the view to create polyline points. When finished, click Stop Picking Points in the property editor.
Targets - Polyline points. Can be edited in the table or interactively in the view Start Picking Points / Stop Picking Points - Button to start / stop picking mode Line Appearance - Set line color and thickness When a user defined polyline annotation tree node is selected, the polyline target markers become visible. Those can be dragged around as decribed above.
Polyline Imported From File To import a polyline annotation from file, right click Annotations or Polylines From File tree node in the global annotations sub tree. Then select the file to import and click OK. Imported polyline annotations are not editable.
File - Name of the imported file Line Appearance - Set line color and line thickness Polyline File format Define each point as three double per line (X Y Depth). Comment lines are supported by using # at the start of the line

Global annotations visibility, on the other hand, is controlled by the check boxes in both the global and local annotations sub trees. So in order to display a global annotation in a specific view, both the annotation tree note itself and its representation in the local sub tree must have visibilty enabled.
`,html:`<p>ResInsight supports displaying a few types of annotations in 3D views and Contour Map view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text annotations</li>
<li>Reach circle annotations</li>
<li>Polyline annotations

<h2 id="global-scope-vs-local-scope-annotations">Global scope vs local scope annotations</h2>
<p>Global annotations may be displayed in all views and are located in the <strong>Annotations</strong> project tree node right below <strong>Grid Models</strong> (Global annotations sub tree). Local annotations are associated with a specific view and are located in the <strong>Annotations</strong> project tree node below the view node (Local annotations sub tree). All annotation types except text annotations are global only. Text annotation may be either global or local.</p>
<p>All global annotations also have a representation in the local <strong>Annotation</strong> tree node in order to toggle visibilty per view. Those annotations are located in tree nodes starting with <strong>Global</strong>.</p>

Global annotations sub tree</p>
<h2 id="text-annotations">Text Annotations</h2>
<p>There are two ways of creating a new text annotation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click <strong>Annotations</strong> or <strong>Text Annotations</strong> tree node in either the global annotatyion sub tree or the local annotations sub tree. The scope of the annotation depends on which node was clicked. When text annotations are created this way, all text annotation fields must be entered manunally in the property editor.</li>
<li>Right click on an object in the view and select <strong>Create Text Annotation</strong>. ResInsight will then create a text annotation at the clicked point. In this case, only th text must be entered manually in the property editor. When creating a text annotation this way, it will become a local annotation by default.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/TextAnnotationPropertyEditor.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anchor Point</strong> - The interesting point in the view</li>
<li><strong>Label Point</strong> - The point where the text label is placed</li>
<li><strong>Text</strong> - The text to display. Multiline supprted. The first line will be the name of the annotation in the project tree</li>
<li><strong>Text appearance</strong> - Set font size, font color, background color and anchor line color</li>
</ul>
<p>When a text annotation tree node is selected, target markers in each end of the anchor line are displayed. The targets can be clicked and dragged. Clicking the blue part lets the user drag the target vertically (along Z axis). Clicking the magenta part lets the user drag the target in the XY plane.</p>
<h2 id="reach-circle-annotations">Reach Circle Annotations</h2>
<p>To create a reach circle annotation, right click <strong>Annotations</strong> or <strong>Reach Circle Annotations</strong> tree node in the global annotations sub tree. Then enter values in the property editor.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/CircleAnnotationPropertyEditor.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - Name of the circle annotation</li>
<li><strong>Center Point</strong> - Center point of the circle. Format &lsquo;x-pos y-pos depth&rsquo;</li>
<li><strong>Radius</strong> - Circle radius</li>
<li><strong>Line Appearance</strong> - Set circle color and line thickness</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-defined-polyline-annotations">User Defined Polyline Annotations</h2>
<p>To create a user defined polyline annotation, right click <strong>Annotations</strong> or <strong>User Defined Polyline Annotations</strong> tree node in the global annotations sub tree. The property editor for the newly created annotation is displayed and is in picking points mode. The user may now click on objects in the view to create polyline points. When finished, click <strong>Stop Picking Points</strong> in the property editor.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/UserDefinedPolylineAnnotationPropertyEditor.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Targets</strong> - Polyline points. Can be edited in the table or interactively in the view</li>
<li><strong>Start Picking Points / Stop Picking Points</strong> - Button to start / stop picking mode</li>
<li><strong>Line Appearance</strong> - Set line color and thickness</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user defined polyline annotation tree node is selected, the polyline target markers become visible. Those can be dragged around as decribed above.</p>
<h2 id="polyline-imported-from-file">Polyline Imported From File</h2>
<p>To import a polyline annotation from file, right click <strong>Annotations</strong> or <strong>Polylines From File</strong> tree node in the global annotations sub tree. Then select the file to import and click OK. Imported polyline annotations are not editable.</p>
<p><img src="/ResInsight-UserDocumentation/images/3d-main-window/PolylineFromFileAnnotationPropertyEditor.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File</strong> - Name of the imported file</li>
<li><strong>Line Appearance</strong> - Set line color and line thickness</li>

Tensors are arrows showing the average principal vectors in an element, shown on every visible face of the element.
The tensor results editor is found in a geo mechanical model&rsquo;s View in the project tree as seen below.
Visualization The tensor arrows visualize the principal vectors in three directions. Each colored pair of arrows represents a principal. In the example above, the orange and blue arrows represent pressures and the white arrows represent a tension.
Properties Value Tensor Results of an element can be calculated from one of the three result values SE, ST and E.
Visibility Choose which of the three principals to be shown. The threshold removes all principals with an absolute value less than or equal to the threshold value.
Vector Colors Choose which color palette to use for the three arrows. The colors appear in &ldquo;correct&rdquo; order (first color = principal 1).
The vector color Result Colors is special. By choosing this color type, a new legend will appear. This legend is defined by the values in the Legend definition of the Element Tensor Results. The extreme values of the color mapper are the extremes of the three principals combined. In the example below, the color result is SE-S1. The largest arrow (principal 1) is quite similar to the cell color, as expected.
Vector Size Scale method Result scales the arrows relative to the maximum result value of all components in the model. With scale method Constant, all the arrows are set to an equal constant size. The overall arrow size can be adjusted by using the Size Scale.

It can also be configured to visualize geomechanical simulations from ABAQUS.
The system also constitutes a framework for further development and can be extended to support new data sources and visualization methods, e.g. additional solvers, seismic data, CSEM, and more.
Efficient User Interface The user interface is tailored for efficient interpretation of reservoir simulation data with specialized visualizations of properties, faults and wells. It enables easy handling of a large number of realizations and calculation of statistics. To be highly responsive, ResInsight exploits multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Efficient plotting of well log plots and summary vectors is available through selected plotting features.
Data Support The main input data is *.GRID and *.EGRID files along with their *.INIT and restart files *.XNNN and *.UNRST. Summary vectors can be imported from *.SMSPEC files. ResInsight also supports selected parts of Eclipse input files and can read grid information and corresponding cell property data sets from *.GRDECL files. Well log data can be imported from *.LAS files.
ResInsight can also be built with support for Geomechanical models from ABAQUS in the *.odb file format.
Updating and Refining Eclipse simulation models ResInsight contains several pre-processing tools for updating and improving Eclipse reservoir models, including but not limited to:
Adding Well Path Completions such as fractures, fishbones and perforations to well paths, including transmissibility calculations to allow for simulation in Eclipse. Easily and visually generate setup files for Local Grid Refinement (LGR) The generation of Eclipse Multi Segment Well-models for well path completions. Flow Diagnostics Flow diagnostics calculations are embedded in the user interface and allows instant visualization of several well-based flow diagnostics properties, such as : Time of flight, flooding and drainage regions, well pair communication, well tracer fractions, well allocation plots and well communication lines. The calculations are performed by a library called opm-flowdiagnostics developed by SINTEF Digital. More&hellip;
Octave Integration Integration with GNU Octave enables powerful and flexible result manipulation and computations. Derived results can be returned to ResInsight for further handling and visualization. Eventually, derived and computed properties can be directly exported to Eclipse input formats for further simulation cycles and parameter studies.
Project organization ResInsight is developed by Ceetron Solutions in collaboration with with Equinor.
ResInsight is a part of the Open Porous Media Initiative. The software is hosted at GitHub, and the development progress can be monitored there. The GitHub issue tracker is heavily used to organize the development process.
